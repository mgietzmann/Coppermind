Several things have changed since Lydia and I decided on Florida. The biggest one is probably that I have no idea what a job for me is going to look like at the end of my current bout of education. I don't know how fisheries is going to change or look different between now and then and I certainly can't depend upon Federal jobs existing or even universities looking the same. There are still lots of options, don't get me wrong, but none of them have clear locations associated with them. 

>My job options are no longer tied to specific places

Beyond this I'm now pursuing a PhD which means I'm having to divert money to the additional year or two that I'll be in school. And it's a lot of money - $20k or so. Spread over the next year and a half that's a $1.1k bill every month which makes any kind of extra spending a ridiculous proposition. 

>My PhD is going to cost me an additional $20k over the next couple of years

Finally I am becoming much more politically active now, something that depends a great deal on connections and who you are working with. Furthermore it's going to take up a lot of my time meaning that these kinds of excursions I was looking forward to in Florida just aren't going to happen. 

>I don't have time for lovely excursions between school, work, and volunteering

All in all then it would fiscally irresponsible for me to go spend a whole heap of money just to move to Florida without even knowing whether I'll be able to stay there long term. Especially given I know I'll get a pay drop if I were to move. 

>I don't have the means to move to Florida or the free time to make it worth it right now. 

So what do I want to have in the meantime?

- An office of my own
- Bookshelves
- A bed I can comfortably sleep in
- A kitchen I can enjoy making food in
- Some fish or something like that 
- A place to have people over to play games and just hang
- A nice bar
- A great home cinema
- A whiteboard/blackboard
- A dog
- Low utility bills (especially heating)
- Affordable rent
- The ability to play music
- The ability to watch a movie at night
