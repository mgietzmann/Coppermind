# Tag Construction: Subtopic Breakdown

## 1. Material Selection
- Corrosion resistance (e.g., marine-grade plastics, titanium, epoxy resins)
- Pressure tolerance (deep-sea tags vs. shallow water)
- Thermal expansion compatibility (prevents cracks between housing and sensors)
- Biofouling resistance (coatings, smooth surfaces)

## 2. Waterproofing and Pressure Sealing
- Resin potting vs. O-ring/air-filled enclosures
- Design for hydrostatic pressure resistance (especially >100m)
- Avoiding internal air bubbles that create weak points under pressure

## 3. Shape and Hydrodynamics
- Streamlining to reduce drag and minimize animal energy cost
- Use of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) for shape optimization
- Species-specific shapes (e.g., penguins vs. sea turtles)

## 4. Mechanical Integration of Sensors
- Internal vs. external sensor exposure
- Secure sensor-housing interfaces to withstand temperature cycling
- Designing for rapid sensor response (minimizing thermal inertia)

## 5. Thermal Management
- Protection from overheating (especially with high-density batteries)
- Management of external temperature swings
- Use of thermal buffering materials or internal separation

## 6. Modular or Integrated Design
- Monolithic vs. modular tag architecture
- Swappable sensor, power, and transmission components
- Trade-offs between flexibility and robustness

## 7. Battery Housing and Power Considerations
- Encapsulation of batteries (e.g., lithium-ion, LTC)
- Placement for thermal and balance stability
- Design for energy harvesting (solar, thermal, kinetic)

## 8. Mounting Interfaces and Attachment Design
- Integration with fins, flippers, shells (e.g., clamps, adhesives, harnesses)
- Load-bearing strength of attachment points
- Attachment method’s effect on hydrodynamics

## 9. Manufacturability and Miniaturization
- Methods: CNC machining, injection molding, 3D printing
- Strategies for mass production vs. field customization
- Push for ultra-small, species-inclusive designs

## 10. Failure Modes and Durability
- Common failures (seal breaks, resin cracks, battery swelling)
- Stress testing (pressure chambers, thermal cycling)
- Long-term reliability in varied marine environments



# Material Selection for Marine Tag Construction

## 1. Corrosion Resistance
- Tolerance to saltwater and long-term immersion
- Avoidance of galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals
- Use of coatings (e.g., anodized aluminum, marine epoxy)
- Material choices: titanium, 316 stainless steel, PEEK

## 2. Mechanical Strength and Fatigue Resistance
- Pressure and compression resistance (deep-water deployments)
- Tensile, impact, and flexural strength
- Durability under mechanical shock and long-term vibration

## 3. Thermal Properties
- Thermal expansion compatibility between housing and sensors
- Heat dissipation or insulation for electronics
- Resistance to rapid thermal cycling (e.g., dive–surface–dive loops)

## 4. Weight and Buoyancy Considerations
- Density relative to seawater (neutral or adjusted buoyancy)
- Use of syntactic foam, air cavities, or ballast materials
- Lightweight but durable options for mobile species

## 5. Biofouling Resistance
- Smooth vs. textured surfaces and their impact on fouling
- Antifouling coatings (e.g., copper-based paints, silicone layers)
- Selection of materials that reduce microbial adhesion

## 6. Biocompatibility
- Non-toxic, inert materials for internal or skin contact
- Common biocompatible choices: PEEK, PTFE, silicone
- Minimized risk of irritation, abrasion, or immune reaction

## 7. Manufacturability
- Suitability for CNC machining, molding, or 3D printing
- Bonding and adhesion behavior with resins and adhesives
- Availability of off-the-shelf stock in required dimensions

## 8. Environmental Degradation Resistance
- UV stability (especially for solar or surface tags)
- Resistance to hydrolysis, oxidation, or salt infiltration
- Durability under pH swings or thermal stress

## 9. Cost and Availability
- Trade-offs between high-performance and budget materials
- Comparison of titanium, stainless steel, polycarbonate, Delrin
- Consideration of bulk procurement or rapid prototyping needs

## 10. Electrical and Thermal Insulation
- Dielectric properties for housing sensitive electronics
- Selection of potting materials: epoxy, silicone, urethane
- Material behavior under load and current
