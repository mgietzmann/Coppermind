By repeating this process you'll quickly realize there's more out there then you could possibly hope to capture in one go. Indeed you'll probably find each subtopic could have a book written on it. When you get to this point, it's time to choose a subtopic and repeat.

Once you're down to a subtopic you'd like one chapter on, then it's time to build ChatGPT a library.
