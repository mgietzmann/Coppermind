If you could recommend 15 papers or technical documents to someone wanting to learn about ___ what would they be?

Take note of where the topic falls in the following hierarchy.

---

Based on those resources how would you subdivide the topic in subcategories? 

---

Using those resources and drawing on others, write a technical review of the topic. Be careful to cite your sources for each of your assertions/notes and include an APA style bibliography. Also please write this with the same terseness of Hemingway's writing.

*Then just read and start asking questions so you can get updates (good to do this using canvas)*


## The Idea

So writing intros is probably the most annoying part of writing papers and the reason for this is that you're trying to create an up to date view on a whole variety of subjects. This means that:

1. Whenever someone points out an additional tidbit of information you're suddenly back to a whole bunch of reorganization
2. Whenever you find a new piece yourself future paper introductions are going to change
3. Whenever there's a new angle finding the relevant papers becomes a huge deal
4. You often have to read a whole bunch of nonsense just to get at the bits you care about

So it'd be really nice if:

- Search through papers was easy and didn't just give you papers but the specific highlights from those papers
- You could then summarize the key findings from a whole bunch of relevant research


## Modes of Operating

1. **Updating a Snapshot**: in this case we start with both a snapshot and some new set of papers. I'd go ahead and read the discussions on each of the papers myself and pull out highlights on each of them. Then I want to update my snapshot given the new additions. 

I can take the snapshot I already have and intersperse it with specific comments on what I would like to change, then have ChatGPT rewrite it for me. 

2. **Searching for Papers**: in this case I've got a new topic I'm interested in and want to search through my current library for papers of interest. 

Here I can give ChatGPT a paper and then ask for 

3. **Initial Snapshot Writeup**: Given a series of points I would like a snapshot that's cited and everything. 
4. **Summarizing a Snapshot for an Introduction**: Here we have a snapshot and just want to pull the relevant pieces for an introduction.
