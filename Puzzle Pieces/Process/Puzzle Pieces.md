I've been reading a bunch of more casual books on science, the most recent being Dinosaurs at the Dinner Party. It has been interesting to note the degree to which little clues here and there ended up amounting to rather large additions to the greater picture. And this has me realizing that there's a specific aspect of science that I have been hesitant to partake in - puzzle piece collecting. Most of what I'm up to can be considered "project work" - work where there are very specific well outlined goals. However this kind of work more or less excludes the collection of bits and bobs that can eventually lead to interesting additions to the greater tapestry. An analogy that has been helpful is to think of a museum. The museum spends a great deal of time on the dioramas, exhibits, full skeletons and statues and so on because that's what is then shared with the broader public - it is the polished finished work. However this work comes in great part from accumulations of random fossils, specimens, writings and other historic and natural "trinkets" that fill the archives of that same museum. Both of these components are as such very important. Without the puzzle piece collecting you'll never start pulling together new and interesting exhibits, but without the exhibits all your puzzle collecting will be for naught. The difference between them is simply whether a level of investigative narrative has been brought together just yet to pull them into a clear story for the public. 

Anyways it is now my plan to incorporate this puzzle piece collecting as part of my day to day - the important thing is just to make sure I actually collect them so that when an interesting narrative arises I've got them all ready to go.
