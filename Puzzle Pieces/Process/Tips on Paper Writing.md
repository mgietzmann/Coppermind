# Catalyst not Byproduct

Writing a research paper is not a task reserved for the end of a project. Instead, it is a continuous and iterative process that evolves alongside your research. A paper should be a catalyst for your research, not a byproduct that comes at the end. 

# Before You Start Research/Development

Our objectives here are to:
- Clarify our research/development objects 
- Obtain a very clear definition of success and what's required to make it compelling
- Create a detailed plan of action to de-risk our efforts/expenditure

What we'll end up with:
- An introduction
- A methods section
- The outline of our discussion

## Step 1: Laying Out Your Research Question

> _What you've got so far:_ a vague idea.

Before you begin writing, you need to establish a clear research question. A research question should be posed as a single overreaching goal and then a series of objectives you intend to meet in order to satisfy the overarching goal. So before getting anything else, draft up that goal and the objectives as you understand them right now. 

Then to begin working out what you'll need in your introduction, ask yourself:

- Why is this outcome important?
- To whom is it important? 
- Is this already answered by other work out there?
- If not how can I "stand on the shoulders of giants"? 

At this point you should just jot down your best answer to these questions off the top of your head. Don't take more than 5 or 10 minutes doing this, as with the rest of this process we're going to iterate a lot. Once you've done so ask yourself questions like the following:

- Are there similar kinds of problems or questions that have already been addressed?
- Should I expand my problem or question?
- What's vague about the answers I've written down?
- What are my likely blindspots about the question and its background at the moment? 

The point here is to find any obvious holes in your understanding/posing right here and right now. Update your initial answers where necessary and then start writing out a collection of questions you want answered to fill in your own blindspots or expand on your current knowledge base.

## Step 2: Conducting a Literature Review

> _What you've got so far:_
> 1. A general thesis
> 2. A list of questions

One of the best places to start in a literature review is with work similar to your own. The reason for this is very simple - their introductions will likely look at lot like yours. They will know the background, they will know the justifications, and they will probably have a good idea of how to pose the research. Plus you want to quickly root out whether or not there's any need for your research or development in the first place (always better when you can just pull something off the shelf). So with that in mind, start by finding a couple of papers (and I do mean a couple) that are closest to the work you're going to try to do. 

> One important consideration is what is "enough" background. For example when I was working on bycatch mitigation for the pollock fishery I went ahead and only got background on that specific bycatch issue. However what I should have done was gone ahead and understood the background behind bycatch issues in general. Why? Because that then helps me see much more clearly what I'm missing from my picture of the issue. 

After you've read your first paper draft out a brief outline of how you'd want your introduction to go (i.e. main points, sub points, and flow) if you had to write one this very moment. Clearly the point is not to write an introduction just yet but this is going to make attaching each paper to what you're going to write much much easier. 

Then with each new paper you read:

1. Update your outline with anything useful you learned from the paper (and attach a numbered reference to the paper and any useful quotes)
2. Update your list of questions by either adding new ones or by checking off ones now answered (or both if the paper brings up and answers something new)
3. Go to the references and grab anything interesting

You'll want to keep reading papers until:

- You've got no open questions that you don't expect to by answered through your research/development
- Your outline has stopped changing
- There are no references you've picked up that look especially different or interesting

## Step 3: Writing an Introduction

> _What you've got so far:_
> 1. A general thesis
> 2. A detailed outline with references

Now it's time to take your outline and turn it into an introduction! First drafts are always extremely rough and a bummer to write (writer's block galore) so this is a great opportunity to take advantage of AI. You can more or less give your outline to something like ChatGPT and just have it write a rough draft for you. This will then give you something to edit into a form you like instead of having to start from scratch. 

But now you have a clear research question, a justification, and you know you're doing something new _and_ taking advantage of past expertise!

## Step 4: Defining Success

At the end of all of this you'll want to have a convincing argument that you've achieved the goals and objectives set out in your introduction. So a question you want to ask yourself right now is what you'll need to make such a convincing argument and how that argument will be structured. This is because whatever research/development you do will need to fill out the points of this argument so you'd better know ahead of time what you're aiming at! 

It's important then at this stage to consider:

1. Who you're trying to convince
2. What compels them
3. The main points in your argument
4. The limitations of the approach (you can only be compelling when you know the boundaries of what it is you do)

Then as with everything we've done so far draft out a rough outline of what this argument would look like and its necessary components. Then ask yourself repeatedly what could be seen as a weakness and fill in how you'd go about resolving that weakness until you have the outline of what would be a bulletproof argument that you've achieved your goals. 

Congrats! You've just outlined the first part of your discussion section!

## Step 5: Developing a Research Plan

> _What you've got so far:_
> 1. A ðŸ”¥ introduction
> 2. An outline of the argument to be made in the discussion

As with any kind of project where you can end up expending a lot of precious time and money it's very important to de-risk as much as you can on paper before getting started - and that means created a detailed development/research plan! Which means before you've even started your research you should have already written both an introduction and a methods section. 

Writing up methods is all about starting high level and then repeatedly asking yourself the question - if I gave this recipe to someone else what would go wrong? 

To that end you should start by just sorting out the high level actions that need to be taken and any decision points that might come up (for example if you're going to need to select between different kinds of equipment or do different kinds of modeling depending on what comes up). Then fill in the details (sub tasks, definitions, etc.) based off of that "give a recipe to someone else" question. 

Write it out as an outline with lots of detail because once again you'll be able to give that outline to something like ChatGPT to give you a first draft to start with. Then once you've got the draft just edit until you're happy with what you've got.

# Executing Your Research/Development

---

> _What you've got so far:_
> 1. A ðŸ”¥ introduction
> 2. An outline of the argument to be made in the discussion
> 3. A detailed plan of action (methods section)

With your plan in place, execute your research systematically. What's important here, with regards to writing a paper, is that you keep close track of _how_ you did everything in as much detail as possible. You'll be coming back to fill in more detail in your methods and you'll need to speak to your results so keeping very careful records of everything you do is very important. Everything should relate back to aspects of that "argument outline" you built - so if there's new stuff make sure you update your outline to match. 

The other thing you want to keep track of are any "next steps" that could come out of this research and development. Just jot them down with a quick description so you can add them to your discussion later.
