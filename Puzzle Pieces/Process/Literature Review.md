I'm trying to figure out how to effectively do and then add to literature reviews. This is coming out of me having missed some pretty significant things about pollock depth distributions. 

In the past I have taken the view of "sampling papers" - that is looking through a whole load of papers to get a convergent sense of what is known. But this leads to a lot of reading that apparently doesn't get me very far. 

I've also tried using ChatGPT to help me comb through stuff but it comes to even worse conclusions than I do. :/ 

So I'm going to try a different strategy instead. I'm going to start by posing my question (as always) and then go looking for the very very best papers out there on the subject. How do I define best? By recency, relevance, breadth, value of methods and data, etc. In other words I'll go around looking at a whole load of papers' abstracts but with the intention of picking only one - three papers that I'll actually read on the subject. Whereas before it was always about trying to "find them all" now it will be about being super duper picky. 

Then if those papers leave me with questions I can go looking for more, but if they don't I'll call it good. 

Or you know you could even just begin with a golden paper and then use it to chart a course. Because if someone did really good research they probably have really good references. Furthermore they may have further studies on the point.
