# A Practical Guide to Structuring and Writing Your Research Paper

At the heart of writing a good research paper is clarity of purpose. This guide will help you structure your thinking and your paper from the very beginning, making the writing process smooth and focused.

## 1. Start with the Goal — Define Your Summit

Every research paper starts with a **goal** — the overall thing you hope to achieve or demonstrate.  
Think of this like the **mountain you hope to summit**.  
Your entire paper will revolve around this goal, so you need to be clear about what it is and why it matters.

---

## 2. Outline the Objectives — Choose Your Trails

Next to your goal are your **objectives** — the specific things you will do to accomplish the goal and to prove that you’ve done so.  
Think of these like the **specific trails you’ll use to get to the summit**.

Good objectives are:
- **Concrete** (you will be able to check them off as complete)
- **Convincing** (each one clearly supports the goal)
- **Well-scoped** (not too broad, not too narrow)
- **Show, Don't Tell**

It's helpful at this point to play devil's advocate and look for the holes in the argument you're going to be building through these objectives. 

On the *Show Don't Tell* front it's important to recognize that there are two ways to try and persuade someone of something - you can try explaining or you can try showing. Showing has two major advantages and should be what you go for every time if you can:
1. **No Mental Gymnastics** - if I explain to you why a specific, say fuel, will make your engine run more efficiently, you have to follow along in a whole bunch of chemistry, physics, and mechanics to understand why. If instead I just run the engine with an without the fuel and show you there's no mental jumping through hoops for you, the reader, to do. This can be the difference between someone having absolutely no idea what I'm talking about and it being clear as day.
2. **The Proof is in the Pudding** - even if you follow me through the mental gymnastics you may not be convinced because you may think I've left something out or something I think will be important isn't. Well once again, if I show you it works, there can be no doubt. 
Always show, don't tell.

## 3. Map the Waypoints — Set the Trailhead Directions

Your reader can’t follow you if they don’t know where you’re starting from.  
**Waypoints** are the background knowledge, key concepts, and past research that your reader needs to understand so your goal and objectives make sense.

Think of these like the **directions to the trailhead** — without them, no one will even get to your starting point.

---

## 4. Build a Rough Outline

The first concrete step is to draft out:
- **Your goal**
- **Your objectives**
- **Your waypoints (background and key prior knowledge)**

This rough outline is your research map. It doesn't have to be pretty — you’ll refine it over time.

---

## 5. Check the Logic — Are You Climbing the Right Mountain?

Once you’ve got a rough outline:
- **Ask yourself if the waypoints make sense.** Is there enough evidence in the existing literature to support your starting point?
- **Fill in gaps.** Now is the time to make sure you have the background knowledge needed to argue for your goal.
- **Test your goal.** Can you make a solid, evidence-based case that this is a worthwhile and achievable summit?

---

## 6. Refine the Objectives — Play Devil’s Advocate

Once your goal and waypoints are solid:
- Go back to your **objectives**
- **Ask if they’re convincing.** If someone challenged you, would your objectives prove the goal beyond doubt?
- Break your objectives down into the **specific arguments, steps, or results** you’ll need to demonstrate

As you do this, you may identify additional waypoints — concepts or evidence the reader will need to follow your argument. Capture these.

---

## 7. Outline Your Methods — Build the Trail

With your objectives clear, start stepping down to the practical level:
- **What data, analysis, or research steps will you need to accomplish each objective?**
- Break this down until you have a clear, step-by-step **Methods section** — directions that someone else could follow to recreate your climb.

---

## 8. What You’ll End Up With

Once you’ve gone through this process, you’ll have:
- A clear **goal** (your summit)
- A set of **objectives** (your trails)
- A set of **waypoints** (background and prior knowledge)
- A detailed outline of the **methods** (your route)

At this point, writing the paper becomes straightforward. You’ll simply be **coloring inside the lines you’ve already drawn**.

---

## 9. Structure of Your Paper

The classic research paper structure follows directly from this process:

| Section         | Content                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction** | Presents the *waypoints*, leading clearly to the *goal* and *objectives* |
| **Methods**       | Describes the step-by-step path you followed to achieve the objectives    |
| **Results**       | States the facts and findings, organized according to your objectives     |
| **Discussion**    | Interprets the results, showing how they meet the objectives and goal     |
| **Conclusion**    | Summarizes how the objectives were met and reaffirms the goal             |

---

## 10. Final Step — Fill in the Paper

As you do your research, you’ll essentially be **filling in the blanks**:
- Populate your background and objectives in the **Introduction**
- Fill in your **Methods** as you conduct them
- Drop in your **Results** as they become available
- Use the **Discussion** to make the case that your objectives were met
- Wrap it all up in the **Conclusion**

The final writing step is just **wordsmithing** — making the language clean, clear, and concise.











- the center of writing a paper is defining the overall goal - what it is you hope to achieve with the paper. Think of this as the mountain you hope to summit.
- adjacent to the goal are the objectives. These are the specific things you will do in order to both meet the goal and prove you have met the goal. Think of this like the specific trails you’ll use to get to the summit. 
- finally there is the waypoints on the route to your research. these are the things you need your reader to know from past literature to make your goal self evident and your argument clear. think of this like the directions to the trailhead, without no one will actually be joining you for the climb. 
- the first step in any bit of research is putting the three of these together, starting with the goal, drafting out the objectives and throwing in the waypoints. this rough outline is what you’ll be developing before you even start.
- the first question you should ask yourself is whether the waypoints to your goal make good sense if you’re uncertain about them or realize there are gaps now is the time to fill them to ensure that you’re going to climb the right mountain. if you can make a very solid, evidence based argument for why your goal is a good one, you’re well on your way. 
- Next you’ll want to start filing out your objectives. The first question here is whether they are convincing. Play devils advocate and try to sort out all the details of the argument you’d need to make to convincingly demonstrate you’ve hit your goal. as you go make note of any waypoints you’ll need for folks to follow your argument. capture these but don’t follow them just yet. 
- Finally once you’re happy with things in broad brush strokes, step down a level and start sorting out what you’d need to hit these objectives. your methods will begin to materialize. keep this up until you have directions someone else could follow. 
- what you’ll be left with is a set of waypoints to fill in, objectives to fill in, and step by step instructions of how to make it happen! plus because you’ve thought through your introduction, the entire structure of the paper is all there, writing it will be like coloring in the lines! 
- your introduction obviously contains the waypoints and leads into your goal and its objectives. the methods just recounts your steps with increasing levels of detail as you go through. results follows the format of your objectives but states nothing with valence - just facts. the discussion presents your argument (in the sequence of your objectives) but should rely on nothing but what’s in the results and introduction, and finally your conclusion  just recounts your objective and goals. 
- so now as you do your research you can just fill your paper in. at the end all that will be required of you is wordsmithing to keep things as concise as possible! 






- citations in an introduction aren’t just to support things, they are effectively about providing links out to other research as well to provide additional background if folks are interested
- my semester was wild because I had no real process, laying the groundwork is super important
- it also totally changes how you approach literature review if you are general exploring or just looking for supporting details
- and you can learn a lot of what you should do through a lit review 
- not just about your argument but about how people have done this stuff in the past. there should be an easy explanation for something that is a gap in the world atm
