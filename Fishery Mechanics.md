There are two ways to fix something: tinker or understand. If your dishwasher breaks, you might poke around, watch a video, and hope for the best. That works for minor problems. But deeper issues — like in medicine or aviation — demand experts. You wouldn’t trust a pilot to maintain a plane, or try to treat cancer with cold medicine. Beyond that, a non-expert wouldn't even know how to diagnose things or apply preventative care without guidance from an expert. Real maintenance requires real knowledge.

Fisheries, bizarrely, are run like the dishwasher. We patch things when they break, using partial data and general models. But we lack the kind of deep, mechanistic understanding that lets us truly diagnose problems — let alone prevent them. For example we still don't fully understand where king salmon go, what eats them, or how to factor that into population models and after the recent Atlantic Herring collapse folks started wondering whether whales might matter... 

The truth is, most fisheries lack folks who know a fishery inside and out, like a cardiologist knows the heart. We need to treat fisheries like any other vital system: something worth understanding deeply, maintaining carefully, and trusting to those who know how.

We need fishery mechanics.

P.S.

A question that often comes up is - what use will this information be? Hard to tell when the fishery is nothing but unknowns. A bit aspect of the value of deep expertise is having the knowledge and perspective required to sort out what matters and what doesn’t - but you need a comprehensive view before you can get there. Unknown unknowns are the bane of any activity…
