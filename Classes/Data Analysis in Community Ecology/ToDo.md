#class 

### 2025-03-21

- [ ] Pull down data 
- [ ] Draft data section 
- [ ] Make sure the random forest will run in a reasonable amount of time
- [ ] Come up with some strategies to show that this does use tools from the class
	- [ ] PCA
	- [ ] Clustering
	- [ ] Correlations
	- [ ] (Honestly just go through slides and find techniques)
- [ ] Double check the purpose lines up with something he's looking for (as I've changed it a bit from when we talked)
	- [ ] Also does this really get at identifying groups of species that are highly predictive of one another? Perhaps a clustering approach may work better.
