I've found myself to feel increasing anxious about how I'm not actually helping anyone at the moment. I'm creating a lot of models and demonstrating a whole lot of things, but I don't actually know if it's useful or not. At times it feels like this paper writing business is a dead end. 

But I'm only feeling this because I know the product driven mindset I've been developing over the past few years is just totally absent. No one at school talks about it or seems to think in that way. The paper is the end goal when in my mind the paper is just the rationalization and description of the thing that really matters - the product, knowledge, or intervention that gets *used*. And I know that to get something used you need to bring the users onto the ground floor from day one. 

And that's what's missing - I have no direct access to anyone in these fleets, I have no real clue if any of this would be useful to them. At some point I need to make that connection, I need to bring that in and make it click. Because here's the thing, being able to pass this level of scientific muster is only making my research and thinking better. It's a level of scrutiny and thoughtfulness that I've never before experienced and used properly it's amazing! But I also know that within the scientific community that product mindset is just totally lacking. If you could bring the two of these together... 

I'll get there. Right now I need to focus on getting really good at just being a scientist. I'm already finding myself booked up just learning how to write these papers and taking classes. If I tried to be entrepreneurial about this I'd crack. 

But, once I've got a couple of these papers under my belt, it's time to drive hard at bringing a product mindset into collab with the scientific mindset I'm now building. What I'm writing right now will probably end up being a curiosity and nothing more, but that's alright because I'm learning.

P.S.

OMG I just realized I can start practicing bringing in the product aspect of things with the tags! 'Cause there I have a direct line to the people who use 'em. 

Excellent
