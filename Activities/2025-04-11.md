- Movement Model Paper
	- [x] Understand the Applications to Targeting (The point here is that the gradients let you do things you couldn't otherwise do)
		- [x] Can I make a strong enough argument with what I already have? (between what I've been researching and the manuscript)
	- [x] What's known about Chinook movement? 
	- [x] Write up an introduction (snapshot) on Chinook movement and distributions 
	- [ ] Building Features!
		- [x] Hypothesis 1 
			- [x] It's not South, it's down the coast
			- [x] Create new features
			- [x] Set off initial models
			- [x] Check hyperparameters
				- [x] Implement early stopping
				- [x] Try a much wider range of hyperparameters
			- [x] Needed to add direction anyways to give a sense of "down"
		- [ ] What's still left now that we've included these features? 
			- [ ] Visualizations by area (bar plot)
				- [ ] For the worst ones look at the individual movement decisions
			- [ ] Look at the overall gradients
			- [ ] Walk on it and form some hypotheses (and determine whether this is worth pursuing further or if you have enough for the paper)
	- [ ] Setup Sabrina's app
	- [ ] Address comments
- Puzzle Pieces
	- [x] Show don't Tell
	- [ ] The importance of hypotheses
		- [ ] And connecting them back to the show

Over the next couple weeks it's:
- [x] Show Don't Tell
- [ ] Sabrina's Cloud Tool
- [ ] Last Couple Weeks of School
- [ ] Depth Paper
