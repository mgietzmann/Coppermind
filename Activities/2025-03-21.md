This week I'll be in Carlsbad to do some project planning with Viasat and I've somehow ended up with two homeworks due in the same week (after something like 2 weeks of no homework due at all). As a result I'll be primarily focused on those two things. If we're able to clear stuff out of the way I'll come back around to working on the paper for the depth model.

Looked over the 4th homework and it seems pretty straightforward so we'll definitely just do:

Homework 3 -> Homework 4 -> Back to Papers
