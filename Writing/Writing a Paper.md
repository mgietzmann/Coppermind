# Writing an Introduction

An introduction's purpose is to leave no doubt that your goal is important and novel. 

The goal itself should be solution independent. A solution dependent goal indicates a lack of specificity. Suppose you had the goal - find a train for my commute. Why the train and not the bus? Likely because busses are slower and less direct. "Find a timely form of transportation for my commute" would be a better goal. Solution dependent goals are poorly specified and poorly specified goals obscure ingenious solutions. 

With the goal in hand, writing an introduction is a matter of working up to a point of collective value. Recursively ask yourself - what larger opportunity or issue is this part of? Make those increments as specific as possible and keep them solution independent. Each level will set your goal in a more substantive narrative. Once you arrive at a narrative your audience collectively appreciates, flip the levels around - you'll have the key points in a funnel that begins on common ground and works its way down to your goal. 

Next, those points need support. Support comes in three forms - elaboration, evidence, and distinction. Elaboration ensures each level is clear to the reader. Evidence makes the value of the level undeniable. Distinction indicates when a level is presently unaddressed. As you collect them, put them under scrutiny. Is this support enough? Are there contrasting opinions? Where are the holes? Capture the support carefully as they will become your paragraphs. 

Also be careful to capture only those details that matter. While the process of capture requires a literature review and reviews should be comprehensive, arguments should be precise. Proof by verbosity is no proof. The simplest argument is always the most powerful. So strive for simplicity without pulling punches. 

Writing a worthwhile introduction is an act of craftsmanship that can take days or weeks. However it is time well spent. The purpose of an introduction is to leave no doubt that your goal is important and novel - a good place to be before commencing on months or years of research. 

# Writing Methods

The methods is a recipe for your objectives. At the end, the reader should have no doubt that if they follow your recipe, they'll hit your objectives. 

Given they must produce the objectives, your methods should be organized in the same way - one section per objective. Meeting objectives, however, can be a complicated process and so each of these sections should follow a specific form. 

First you will introduce how you will frame your objective as a solution. "To meet X we will do Y" followed by any details required to frame Y explicitly. Within those details weave in "because of Z" so that your reader understands why you chose this framing. At the end of this paragraph it should be clear to the reader what you are going to do if even the how is still unclear.

The next paragraph should provide a summary of the how. When recipes are long, having a mental map to refer back to is useful. Begin this paragraph with a clear statement that this is a summary of the recipe to follow and then present each of the steps in chronological order. Be concise - details will follow.

Now we move onto the details. Using lead/details (L/D) form write a paragraph or two for each step in your outline. It is important that these steps and their description follow in chronological order - you want your audience to be able to replicate what you did. To ensure accurate replication you also want to make sure there can be no doubts about what you did. Use clear language your audience will understand, leave out no relevant detail, and weave in the why of a method as you go along. 

Finally it is important that everything in your results points back to something explicit in your methods. If you report on something but there is no recipe, your methods have failed. 

Like an introduction the methods are there to remove doubt about your approach. A good methods will convince the reader that anyone following your recipe will hit your objectives. Therefore, as with the introduction, it is a good idea to outline your methodology before you even get started.
