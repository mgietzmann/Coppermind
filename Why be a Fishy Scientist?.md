Why fisheries science? Well the fisheries part is easy - I've wanted to be a part of biosphere stewardship since I was a little kid catching frogs and keeping a track of who I caught and when. But I also wanted something that could take advantage of my technical skills and had a direct food security element - both passions I picked up along the way. Fisheries has all of these things so it was a no brainer. 

Why be a scientist specifically? Well, initially I wanted to be involved in fisheries management directly. as I dug deeper into how fisheries management actually works—and how it _should_ work—I started to notice some patterns.

First, no matter what policies are in place, the more targeted a fishery can be, the better. But precision in fisheries is nearly impossible without a deep understanding of fish behavior. Second, I saw growing calls for spatial assessment and management, both of which also hinge on behavioral insights. And finally, in my own philosophizing about management, I came to the conclusion that in the highly dynamic, non-linear system an ecosystem is, in order to manage a species responsibly you have to understand the strategies and backstops that species is using to survive - once again behavior is key. In other words, over and over again, I saw a need for better understanding and models of fish movement and behavior.

But beyond the the need, it turned out that behavioral fisheries science is just plain _awesome._ Collecting data on individual fish behavior is a huge technical problem - the kind of problem I find absolutely fascinating. Taking that data and turning it into useful knowledge requires rather sophisticated data analysis and modeling - once again the kind of thing I love. And finally, in loads of cases, the knowledge gained seemed to have very direct and obvious links back to both the management and value of the fishery in question. So kind of the perfect problem for me. 

But being a scientist solves another problem for me as well. Given we're living in a world with a lot of societal scale problems I've always felt a bit of an obligation to think big and try to figure out how to solve the overall problem. What's the point in taking a shovel to a mountain? This big thinking, however, almost always led to the same place - the need for some kind of company or non-profit. I, however, have no interest in running a business. What I do have a great interest in, because I've always loved doing it, is teaching and mentoring folks. And guess what? That's exactly how you scale up to the full problem in science, by taking your expertise and using it to build an army! So once again, kind of the perfect spot for me.

So why fisheries science? Because fisheries science brings together everything I care about and love doing — biosphere stewardship, food security, biology, instrumentation, modeling, teaching, mentoring, and even a touch of philosophy. It’s a field where I can solve fascinating problems, contribute to sustainable management, and scale up to the whole mountain by mentoring others. It's just a perfect fit.
