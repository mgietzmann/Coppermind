### Depth Range by Life Stage in Walleye Pollock: A Technical Review

Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) exhibit ontogenetic shifts in vertical distribution that are closely linked to physiological constraints, trophodynamic interactions, and spatiotemporal environmental gradients. Depth occupancy at each life stage reflects a dynamic interplay between metabolic requirements, habitat structure, and predator-prey dynamics, resulting in functional segregation of the water column that enhances ecological efficiency and minimizes intra-cohort competition.

#### Eggs and Larvae

Spawning occurs primarily in late winter and early spring across key habitats such as Shelikof Strait and the southeastern Bering Sea. Eggs are pelagic and exhibit positive buoyancy relative to ambient seawater, typically suspended between 100 and 200 m (Kendall & Picquelle, 1990; Rugen & Seki, 1981). Variability in egg-specific gravity is strongly modulated by temperature and salinity, which together define the vertical position of the developing embryo (Rugen & Seki, 1981).

Following hatching, larvae ascend into the upper mixed layer, typically within the upper 100 m. This stratum offers thermally favorable conditions, high light penetration, and elevated concentrations of microzooplankton prey (Hinckley et al., 2001; Matarese et al., 2003). Larval vertical distribution is neither static nor homogenous; it is shaped by ontogeny, prey distribution, light gradients, and turbulence (Sakurai et al., 1996). Smart et al. (2013) further confirmed that ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) patterns in larvae reflect trade-offs between foraging opportunities and environmental stressors.

Vertical positioning has direct implications for larval survival. Sub-optimal depth selection may expose individuals to increased predation risk or thermal instability, while turbulent mixing in upper strata can displace larvae from prey-rich zones. These dynamics highlight the critical role of fine-scale vertical habitat selection during early ontogeny.

#### Juveniles

As individuals transition into the juvenile stage, vertical distribution becomes increasingly influenced by diel cycles and developmental stage. Age-0 juveniles initiate diel vertical migration (DVM), characterized by a nocturnal ascent into upper layers and daytime descent to 100–200 m (De Robertis et al., 2005). The extent of migration varies ontogenetically, with amplitude increasing as individuals grow and gain greater physiological control over depth selection.

Laboratory experiments indicate a thermal preference for 4–8°C, corresponding to depths of approximately 100–200 m depending on seasonal stratification (Hurst et al., 2012). Observational data suggest that juveniles occupy deeper, more thermally stable layers by late summer and fall (Wilson et al., 2016). These shifts are attributed to changing prey fields, thermal habitat constraints, and predator avoidance.

Recent modeling by Holsman et al. (2023) suggests that juvenile Pollock exhibit more conservative latitudinal responses to climate forcing compared to adults, emphasizing life-stage-specific habitat fidelity. Empirical work by Ressler et al. (2021) supports these findings, showing depth occupancy reflects a multi-factor optimization of growth potential, metabolic expenditure, and predation risk.

Despite broad vertical occupancy during juvenile stages, survey data indicate increasing vertical stratification with age (Brodeur et al., 2000). This stratification likely facilitates niche partitioning and limits intercohort trophic overlap.

#### Adults

Adults adopt a semi-demersal mode of existence, characterized by regular occupation of depths between 150 and 300 m. While still exhibiting DVM, adult vertical displacement is less pronounced than that of juveniles, with daily movements constrained by reproductive status, prey fields, and oceanographic conditions (Kotwicki et al., 2005). During diurnal periods, adults commonly aggregate near the seabed; at night, some individuals ascend to midwater layers.

Spawning aggregations are consistently observed at depths of 200–300 m along prominent shelf breaks such as those found in Shelikof Strait and the outer Bering shelf (Oozeki et al., 2007). These zones offer optimal conditions for egg development, retention, and larval advection.

Vertical structure within adult schools is frequently age-stratified. Older, larger individuals are often detected at greater depths (Ianelli et al., 2012), possibly reflecting reduced predation pressure and higher energetic reserves that permit occupation of colder, more stable environments. Seasonal overwintering behavior is marked by vertical compression, with schools occupying depths >250 m (Watanabe & Kishi, 2000).

Recent transboundary acoustic surveys (Cunningham et al., 2024) indicate significant seasonal movement between Russian and U.S. waters in response to ice advance, highlighting the importance of depth-habitat coupling for transboundary stock dynamics.

#### Ontogeny and Depth Transitions

Pollock exhibit a developmental descent through the water column, with each ontogenetic stage characterized by distinct vertical preferences and movement patterns. Eggs and early larvae reside in the upper euphotic zone, exploiting favorable thermal and optical conditions. Juveniles shift deeper as metabolic constraints, prey structure, and behavioral complexity evolve. Adults primarily occupy mesopelagic and demersal habitats, returning periodically to midwater depths for foraging or reproductive events.

This ontogenetic descent reduces trophic overlap and inter-stage competition, enhancing population-level resilience. It also aligns life-stage-specific ecological requirements with vertical gradients in temperature, prey availability, and predation pressure. Although the general descent pattern is conserved across systems, bathymetry and local oceanography impose spatial heterogeneity on absolute depth ranges (Yokota & Kawabata, 2002).

### Regional Variability in Depth Use in Walleye Pollock: A Technical Review

Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) are widely distributed across the North Pacific, but their use of depth varies sharply by region. These patterns reflect differences in bathymetry, water column structure, prey fields, and ice regimes.

#### Bering Sea

In the southeastern Bering Sea, juveniles and adults occupy the midwater and upper slope zones, generally from 100 to 300 m (Brodeur et al., 2000; Kotwicki et al., 2005). During summer, diel vertical migration is pronounced in juveniles but weakens with age (De Robertis et al., 2005). Over the shelf, schools often track the thermocline, which sits shallower on the inner shelf and deeper offshore (Stabeno et al., 2012). Northward, in the ice-margin zone, recent warming has drawn Pollock into new habitat. Fish now use deeper waters near the bottom in areas once too cold (Grebmeier et al., 2018).

#### Gulf of Alaska

In the Gulf, vertical distribution differs. Larvae in Shelikof Strait concentrate in the upper 50 m, where surface mixing and prey availability dominate (Hinckley et al., 2001). Juveniles descend into cooler layers, often between 150 and 250 m, guided by thermal limits and predator avoidance (Hurst et al., 2012). Acoustic surveys in the Gulf show looser vertical structure and more scattered aggregations than in the Bering Sea (Ressler et al., 2021). Adults in the Gulf exhibit broad vertical flexibility, with documented diel vertical migration behavior varying seasonally. During spring and summer, adult pollock ascend into the upper 40 m of the water column at night to exploit euphausiid prey aggregations, while in fall they remain deeper, foraging primarily on decapods (Adams, 2009). Acoustic and trawl data collected around Chiswell Island confirmed these patterns, indicating that light availability, prey field composition, and visual foraging constraints shape adult vertical behavior. Spawning adults in Shelikof Strait typically cluster between 225 and 275 m, with vertical distribution modulated by local bathymetry and tidal regimes.

#### Aleutian Basin and Kuril Islands

To the west, in the Aleutian Basin, Pollock form deep, dense layers. Here, depths can exceed 400 m, and diel vertical movements may span 200 m or more (Benoit-Bird et al., 2013). In the Kuril Island region, vertical distributions are tightly linked to bathymetry and upwelling. Pollock often aggregate along slope features, using subsurface fronts to access prey (Sugisaki et al., 2001).

#### Sea of Okhotsk

In the Sea of Okhotsk, adults spawn near the slope at 200–300 m, with diel migrations tied to light penetration and ice edge dynamics (Zuyev et al., 2009). Juveniles occupy the upper 100 m but drop deeper as surface temperatures rise. Their vertical patterns mirror those in the Bering Sea but shift shallower when cold surface water dominates.

#### Climate Forcing and Connectivity

Depth use is not static. Depths cited across regions (e.g., 150–300 m) often correspond to midwater strata but may overlap with the benthic boundary layer depending on local bathymetry. In shelf break zones or deep basins, these depths are fully pelagic. In contrast, near the inner shelf or slope regions, especially during spawning or overwintering, Pollock may occupy layers close to or in contact with the seafloor. Behavioral observations—such as diel migration into upper waters—indicate dynamic vertical positioning within these regional bathymetric constraints. In the eastern Bering Sea, sea ice retreat has relaxed thermal constraints, allowing deeper occupation by juveniles and expanded feeding grounds for adults (Grebmeier et al., 2018). Seasonal migrations across the U.S.–Russia boundary follow depth and ice edges (Cunningham et al., 2024). Ontogenetic descent remains consistent, but the depths at which transitions occur shift with regional oceanography.

### Seasonal Shifts in Depth Occupancy in Walleye Pollock: A Technical Review

Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) change their depth with the season. These shifts are not random. They are driven by light, prey, temperature, and reproduction. Each season brings new constraints and new opportunities. Pollock move accordingly.

#### Spring and Summer

In spring, warming begins at the surface. Ice retreats in the Bering Sea. Pollock, both juvenile and adult, follow the change. In Shelikof Strait and the Gulf of Alaska, adults gather at 200–300 m to spawn (Sigler et al., 2001). Spawning is followed by a vertical spread. Juveniles remain high in the water, near prey and light (Hinckley et al., 2001). Adults move up at night, down by day. Diel vertical migration is most pronounced in this season (De Robertis et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2016).

In the Gulf of Alaska, acoustic work shows adults move into the upper 40 m at night in spring and early summer. They feed on euphausiids aggregated near the surface. In fall, this behavior fades (Adams, 2009). Seasonal prey fields, not just light, shape vertical motion.

#### Fall

As light wanes, surface cooling begins. Prey changes. Euphausiids disperse. Decapods take their place. Pollock shift behavior. In the Gulf, adults stop rising at night. They remain deeper, tracking prey and light isolumes (Adams, 2009).

In the Bering Sea, juveniles that once hovered near 100 m move down. By late fall, they may reach 200 m or more. Surveys confirm this descent (Ressler et al., 2021). Metabolism slows in colder water. Movement becomes sparse. Foraging grows riskier.

#### Winter

Winter brings cold, low light, and ice. In the eastern Bering Sea, Pollock seek thermal refuge. Adults migrate south or to deeper basins. They concentrate near the bottom, below 250 m (Grebmeier et al., 2018). Juveniles also shift down, some overwintering near the seafloor (Zuyev et al., 2009). Feeding declines. Survival depends on reserve.

Seasonal ice cover shapes this shift. In years with early ice, Pollock move sooner and deeper (Cunningham et al., 2024). In warmer years, they linger in midwater. Depth use becomes a barometer of environmental change.

#### Patterns and Implications

Throughout the year, depth tracks prey, light, and temperature. Diel migration shrinks in cold seasons, grows in warm ones. Juveniles descend with age and winter onset. Adults follow prey and reproduction cues. But these rules bend with climate.

Archival tags, acoustic surveys, and gut content analyses now show that vertical shifts are not fixed. They change across basins, years, and life stages (Wilson et al., 2016; Benoit-Bird et al., 2013). Managers must track this fluidity. It defines habitat, catchability, and vulnerability.
