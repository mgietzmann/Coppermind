As you are building out your understanding of a specific subject there is going to be a lot of ground to cover. Just jumping in and reading papers is a bad way to go because you don't even know what to look for! So the first step is getting a sense for the overall lay of the land, after which you can then focus on the details relevant to whatever research question you're interested in. 

So how to build perspective? Well ChatGPT is a great way to get a broad overview very quickly. Problem is if you just ask ChapGPT to give you an overview it's going to give you something way to thin. So we'll have to do some coaxing. 

The other piece is that ChatGPT is very context specific - point it at good material and it will make excellent commentary, leave it to itself and you're really just rolling the dice.

However we can get around both of these problems by asking some structured questions:

#### Step 1: Finding the Shape of your Topic

---

If you could recommend 15 papers or technical documents to someone wanting to learn about ___ what would they be?

Take note of where the topic falls in the following hierarchy.

---

This question gets us started by pulling in relevant and useful information on the topic at hand. Note that second sentence is useful as you're going along and want ChatGPT to have context on the rest of the hierarchy you're building out. 

---

Based on those resources how would you subdivide the topic in subcategories? 

---

This gets ChatGPT doing what it does best - summarizing. You can read through, ask questions, etc. until you are happy with the overall list and then you can save it away in a "table of contents". 

Now simply iterate through each of the subtopics, and through the subtopics of those subtopics until you feel you have a very fine grained list of items where a page or so of summary on each of the leaves in your hierarchy will give you a good grasp on things. 

#### Step 2: Filling out the Details

Now for each of your leaves you can ask:

---

If you could recommend 15 papers or technical documents to someone wanting to learn about ___ what would they be?

Take note of where the topic falls in the following hierarchy.

---

This, once again, preps ChatGPT to give relevant information. 

---

Using those resources and drawing on others, write a technical review of the topic. Be careful to cite your sources for each of your assertions/notes and include an APA style bibliography. Also please write this with the same terseness of Hemingway's writing. 

---

This'll give you a nice quick overview. Ask ChatGPT questions and it will update on the basis of it (especially easy if you use the Canvas feature). Once you have what you like save it away because that reference list will be clutch later when you want to go in depth on something. And besides, you asked a bunch of questions to get here, might as well prevent having to do it again next time! 


Alright I'm finding that on something I know a great deal about this isn't working well. I'm getting far too surface level results from ChatGPT... 

Thing is there really aren't that many good papers on the subject I'm looking into. So maybe this is about finding a few golden papers and then just drawing the highlights from them. Spend a lot of time looking for really good papers and then pull out the parts that are really excellent about them. 

Anyways... still searching for the right way to do a literature survey. 

I really do wonder now if I've just been far too focused on trying to cover all the research instead of just focusing on deeply understanding the very best research...
