### The Day Of

- **Walk us through a typical wedding day for you.**  
  We'd love to get a sense of how you move through the day—when you arrive, what you prioritize, and how you manage the flow from getting ready through to the reception.

- **What's your backup plan in case of an emergency?**  
  Do you work with a team, have a network of other photographers, or carry backup equipment in case something unexpected happens?

- **How do you coordinate during the day—do you take the lead, or blend into the background?**  
  We're curious about your style when it comes to directing shots, organizing people, and capturing the vibe without interrupting it.

- **Could we see a full gallery or two?**

### Deliverables & Timing

- **How are the photos delivered?**  
  Will we receive an online gallery, physical prints, USB, or something else? How long will the gallery be available?

- **Do we get the rights to print and share the photos?**  
  We'd like to understand what's included in terms of usage—can we share on social media, make our own prints, etc.?

### Planning & Prep

- **How do we go about building a shot list with you?**  
  Do you provide a template or guidance on what's typical or recommended? Are there must-have moments you always capture?

- **What are the different styles?**
- Photojournalistic
- Artistic
- Documentary
- Antwerp
- **Candid**

- **How do you usually collaborate with couples before the wedding?**  
  Will there be planning calls, a pre-wedding walkthrough, or a final check-in? What can we expect leading up to the day?

### From Us

- **What do you need from us to help you do your best work?**  
  Are there things you'd love to know about our personalities, the vibe we're going for, or any important family/friend dynamics?

- **What do you wish couples asked or told you ahead of time?**  
  We're open to your perspective—what makes the day smoother or more fun for you and ultimately helps you capture the best moments?


Our Vibe:
- Natural and relaxed (bierhall/farmhouse vibes)
- Two different locations, the cave and then the farm
- In the cave we're planning: 4:30
	- Everyone goes down together
	- Handfasting
	- Vows
	- Exchange of rings
	- All done!
- Farm: 5:30 - 6:30 - 11
	- Cocktail hour
	- Want to get at food asap
	- There'll be dancing (father daughter, mother son) (my brother will likely play something)
	- Typical speeches
	- But overall just want things to be chill 
- There'll be a first look as well, prep for the day, and then we were thinking photos at the cave location (it's quite pretty) - might be an opportunity for photos by the lake as well
