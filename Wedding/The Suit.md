Things I know I want:
- Three piece suit (the waistcoat is just too good)
- The suit needs to be really slim - intended to be left unbuttoned and still look very slim
- A high white collar (I love how it looks on that one shirt I have)
- Snake or alligator texture reddish brown boots 
- Day Cravat as it allows the flared collar look 

Things I need to experiment with:
- I think an ascot could be awesome as it would allow the flared collar look I like so much without being completely informal
- I think I like this kind of double breasted low waist coat - https://www.allaboutchic.com/products/carter-stylish-plum-peaked-lapel-three-pieces-prom-suits-for-men - it brings out the shirt and sort of flares out the whole look (double breasted horseshoe)

Jeez deciding is so hard. I think what I need to do is think up elements that I'd like included in this. Specifically things that relate back to my past in one way or another. Then I can build up from there. 

Like it could be fun to do something like have a set of color bars on each side of the jacket or something for each of the american and south african flags. 

Or adding things onto the lapels. 

These shoes are fantastic - https://taftclothing.com/products/the-jack-boot-in-paradise and I feel like shoes are somewhere you can go a little wild. 

Okay these are also sick - https://www.etsy.com/listing/502660831/genuine-fish-skin-cufflinks-for-men-fish?ref=internal_similar_listing_bot-6&frs=1&logging_key=a0eb2235d1e6243dc51d0ebe78546938cb1b0a7d%3A502660831&listing_id=502660831&listing_slug=genuine-fish-skin-cufflinks-for-men-fish

I could get myself a strawberry thief watch!)
