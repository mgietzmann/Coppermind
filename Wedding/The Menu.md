# Wedding Menu

## Appetizers

- **Brie Bites**  
  *Lydia absolutely loved these — they’re a favorite for sure.*

- **Cheese and Potato Pierogis**  
  *If there are pierogis on the menu, Lydia will order a mountain of them. It’s a guaranteed hit.*

- **Teriyaki Chicken Skewers**  
  *When they're in a rush to catch a movie, they’ll often grab chicken from Sarku Japan. These skewers are a nostalgic nod to a fast food we both love.*

- **Grazing Table**  
  *A spread of cheeses, fruits, pickles, nuts, and little bites — perfect for wandering, chatting, and nibbling.*

## Main Dishes

- **Lamb**  
  *The first meal Marcel ever made for Lydia was lamb lollipops with roasted broccoli and penne alla vodka — lamb has been special to them ever since. It’s also the go-to celebration dish on Marcel’s mum’s side of the family, whether it’s leg of lamb or a comforting lamb curry.*

- **Mustard-Glazed Salmon**  
  *This dish marks the beginning of Lydia’s love affair with seafood — it was the gateway fish! It also honors Marcel’s dad’s side, who fished for salmon in Alaska and always had a king or silver on the table for family occasions.*

- **Vermont Cheddar Mac & Cheese**  
  *Vermont is dear to Lydia’s heart, and they’ve made pilgrimages to Brattleboro just for the mac and cheese from their favorite deli there.*

## Sides

- **Crispy Golden Roasted Potatoes**  
  *The ideal starch to pair with any kind of roast.*

  - Glazed Carrots  
  - Brussels Sprouts  
  - Lemon Pepper Broccoli  
  - Lemon Pepper Asparagus  
  - Roasted Onions  
  - Roasted Garlic  
  - Roasted Cherry Tomatoes  
  - Roasted Fennel  
  - Grilled Pineapple  
  - *(Vegetable selection may vary depending on what looks freshest and most delicious)*

  *The classic pairing for salmon growing up — simple, timeless, and satisfying.*

## Dessert

- **Red Velvet Cupcakes**  
  *The first thing Lydia ever baked for Marcel — and it quickly became his favorite.*

- **Key Lime Pie Bites**  
  *Marcel proposed to Lydia in Florida, just after they spent a few magical days in the Keys. These are a tart little throwback to that moment.*

- **Cider Donuts**  
  *Because... New England, baby!*

- **“First I Love You” Ice-cream Station** *(optional add-on)*  
  *Inspired by the J.P. Licks where they first said “I love you.”*

## Drinks

- **Atlantic Brewing Company Blueberry Ale**  
  *Discovered on their first trip together — and still a shared favorite.*

- **Paulaner Hefeweizen**  
  *Lydia brought Marcel one during a rough week — and that night sparked his love for German beer.*

- **Trillium IPA**  
  *One of their early dates was at Trillium — where they first talked about the kind of family they wanted.*

- **Dr. Konstantin Frank’s Dry Riesling**  
  *A nod to their many wine tasting dates, and to Lydia’s home state of New York.*

- **Sangria**  
  *Lydia brought sangria to their first dinner together — and it’s still her go-to drink wherever they go.*

- **A Red of Clara’s Choosing**  
  *Clara knows what’s good. They trust her.*

- **Mango, Pineapple, and/or Lychee Juices**  
  *A little shoutout to South Africa — and to bright, refreshing flavors they both love.*
