### ToDo

- [ ] Update the paper with the anti-diurnal pattern you found
- [ ] Get a review from folks
- [ ] How do pollock fishermen fish?
	- [ ] Check out the pollock fishing data - [[Trawl Catcher Vessel Profiles.pdf]]
		- [ ] Can we get the actual locations they are fishing?
		- [ ] Is there any info on how deep? 
	- [ ] Check out the bycatch data 
		- [ ] Can we sort out where the bycatch is happening? Maybe get some confirmation of the modeling? 
	- [ ] If I could give advice right now what would it be?
		- [ ] Perhaps just time of day is enough? 
- [ ] Is there any research on walleye pollock depth occupancy?
