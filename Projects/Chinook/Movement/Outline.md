## Waypoints

- Time/Area Closures (and the need for behavioral theory)
- Understanding movement as the only way to study selectivity (whowhenwhere) for highly mobile and rare species
- What is known about Chinook movements today?
- What kinds of models exist today?
	- Note that they are largely non-discretized making for the long term simulation a mighty challenging process (although technically not impossible)
## Goal

Our goal is to demonstrate the value that models, which express movement as discretized distributions, can bring to informing more targeted fisheries practice. 

### Objectives

1. Introduce a strategy for building such models (DONE)
2. Build a movement model that predicts broadscale movement patterns of Chinook salmon in the GOA
	1. Select features that capture the known kinds of movement behavior in Salmon today
	2. Train v Test
	3. Contrast Sampling
	4. Model Exploration
	5. Model Reporting
3. Evaluate the model against known patterns in Chinook salmon movements and the observed movements
	1. ?
4. Providing a series of illustrative examples of how to use the predictions from such a model to inform more targeted fisheries practice (it's not about knowing exactly where they are, just how their movement effects the value of triggered closures and where vulnerability is going to be higher based on their movement patterns)
	1. **Pooling vs Diffusion:** If you have a series of areas in close proximity to one another and some result in pooling (increases in exposure or duration) as opposed to diffusion (decreases in exposure or duration) then the pooling areas become likely hotspots _relative_ to the diffusive areas.
	2. **Pool Movement and Connectivity:** Understanding where the pools move and how they are connected through time helps us indicate:
		1. Increased likelihood of hotspots (if you can be relatively certain of a set of hotspots then what they are connected to becomes more likely)
		2. How the best fishing spots move as a function of time and where the danger zones move with time (also required to look for where movement is opposed to the actual target species)
		3. Ways in which repeat exposure could likely happen
	3. **Value and Timing of Dynamic Closures:** whether through slowing rates of diffusion or pooling where are the spots where dynamic closures make sense vs where don't they? And then also what should the specific timing be on those closures. 
	4. **Separation of Concerns:** one particularly interesting application here is the question of whether the GOA/EBS divide is actually a good idea. How connected are the two areas? 
	5. **Protected Areas:** are seasonal closures even a possibility? Or is there a lot of diffusion? (This would be if you wanted to protect a specific subset of the species)
