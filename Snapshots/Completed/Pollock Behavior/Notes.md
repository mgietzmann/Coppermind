Organization
- I think the place to start is just a quick definition of what Walleye Pollock are, their scientific name, their general location, and just how large of a biomass they have. 
- From there we get into their vertical movements as a result of their spawning aggregations and the migration between that and their feeding waters. We can note the patchiness in actual distribution is very much the result of school and ontogenetics.
- This would be a good time to talk about their spawning behavior and their fast growth rate and general longevity
- This would be a good place to talk about how wide their habitat "niche" is (if it can even be spoken of in that way)
- Then we can get into where they sit in the food chain as that's going to be important context for their depth occupancy. 
- From there we can get into the interesting story of depth occupancy where it seems to be largely driven by food and age group stratification (at least in the EBS)
- We can note that juveniles show strong DVM patterns that seem to be a balance between growth and avoiding cannibalism. We can also note that they seem to be capable of occupying greater ranges of temperatures. 
- Then we can note that the behavior in adults is much less straightforward and seems to be a more complex relationship between feeding and metabolism. 
	- There do seem to be ranges of temperature in which they are most comfortable
	- In spring and summer there does seem to be some level of DVM but in other parts of the year this is non-existent (or is happening at much lower depths)
	- Generally they move to shallower water in the spring-summer and deeper waters in winter and a lot of this has to do with regaining body condition after spawning
	- School mass also seems to be related to how shallow the water is. 
	- Also worth noting that age classes separate themselves in the EBS quite strongly where this isn't such an issue in the GOA
	- All in all it seems that depending on the food sources, body condition, interspecific competition, and temperature ranges, as well as where they are in their yearly cycle between shallower and deeper water the adults can be demersal, pelagic, in shallow water, exhibiting DVM and anything in between although some general drivers of behavior do seem to exist 

Facts to Pull in and their Sources
- Depth Occupancy? 
	- No evidence for diel migration in adults in their particular study (Schwartzman, 1994) although there is evidence for diel migrations in some parts of the year. 
	- School mass is highest in shallow water (<120m) regions (Schwartzman, 1994)
	- Higher biomass schools stay below the thermocline, average school depth increases with bottom depth, and they tend to avoid very cold waters <0C (Schwartzmann, 1994)
	- They seem to move from shallower water in the spring-summer to deeper water in the winter largely in response to body condition related to spawning (Kooka, 1997)
	- It has been hypothesized that juveniles stay above the thermocline to avoid cannabalism (Schwartzman, 1994)
	- The story gets weirder as studies in the GOA suggest that there is daily vertical migrations for adult pollock in April and August, presumably as they follow euphausiids (their main prey at the time). And this can bring some pollock within 20m of the surface at night. However in November this kind of pattern does not emerge and they stay at depth (Adams, 2007)
	- It seems at least part of this is the fact that juveniles are more tolerant of a wider degree of temperatures (Duffy-Anderson, 2003)
	- There do seem to be differences between the EBS and GOA in terms of cannibalism which may explain why there is more mixing between year classes in the GOA than in the EBS where different age groups seem to stratify in the water column (Adams, 2007) (Duffy-Anderson, 2003)
- Just how much is out there?
	- 70% of groundfish biomass in the EBS consists of pollock (Bailey, 2000)
- Spawning and development
	- They spawn in the same places year after year in the late winter and early spring in sea valleys or canyons or indentations in the outer margin of the continental shelf although they are known to spawn in deep bays as well. Eggs are typically deposited very deep (100 - 400m). Larvae occupy the 20m - 60m portion of the water column and exhibit diel migrations. Pollock mature at age 4 (40-45 cm) and can live as long as 20 years and get to 75 cm in length. (Bailey, 2000) They form large spawning aggregations. 
- Feed
	- Adults feed on euphausiids, small fishes, copepods, and amphipods but will feed on many small fish with cannibalism being common. In some years during autumn and winter pollock stomach contents can be 80% juveniles. (Bailey, 2000)
	- They seem to feed largely during the day (Miyashita, 2004) However juveniles feed during both day and night and occupy the same positions in the water column during both times. 
	- June through July there is an abrupt change in body condition indicating a lot of feeding (Miyashita, 2004) It seems that smaller pollock grow faster and feed more in part to avoid cannibalism. 
- Predators
	- Marine mammals and seabirds depend on strong year classes in the EBS (Bailey, 2000)
- Habitat
	- Pollock occupy a large variety of different habitats and can be benthic in some areas, semi-demersal in others and purely pelagic in yet others. (Bailey, 2000)
	- They are distributed from Puget Sound to the northern Bering Sea - they seem to be a very plastic generalist species (Bailey, 2000)
	- The distribution patterns are related to ontogenetics (Bailey, 2000)
	- Pollock (adult) seem to occupy specific temperature ranges 2 - 6C but juveniles will occupy a larger range 4 - 12C (Miyashita, 2004) 
- Behavior
	- The fish school (Bailey, 2000)
- Population dynamics
	- Some think the increase in pollock in the 1960s was related to the harvesting of pacific ocean perch and pacific herring thus creating an ecological release (Bailey, 2000)
	- It seems that the fish constitute two different stocks between GOA and the EBS (Bailey, 2000)
- Scientific name:  Gadus chalcogrammus
- Movement:
	- In late winter/early spring pollock form huge spawning aggregations, including those found in Shelikof Strait and the eastern Bering Sea northwest of Unimak Island. Smaller aggregations in the Gulf of Alaska include those at the Shumagin Islands, the entrance to Prince William Sound, and near Middleton Island. In summer, large aggregations have been found on the east side of Kodiak Island, nearshore along the southern Alaska Peninsula, and other areas. Pollock migrate seasonally between spawning and feeding areas. (ADF&G, 2005)
	- They seem to move from shallower water in the spring-summer to deeper water in the winter largely in response to body condition related to spawning (Kooka, 1997)

Walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_) are one of the most ecologically and commercially significant fish species in the North Pacific. Distributed from Puget Sound to the northern Bering Sea, they are an abundant, schooling codfish that make up approximately 70% of the groundfish biomass in the Eastern Bering Sea (Bailey, 2000). Pollock are a generalist species occupying a wide range of habitats and depth zones across the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), with seasonal movements and behaviors that reflect both environmental cues and life-history stages.

Pollock undertake regular horizontal migrations between spawning and feeding areas (ADF&G, 2005). Large spawning aggregations form annually in late winter and early spring, including major groups in the Shelikof Strait and northwestern Unimak Island, with smaller groups in the Shumagin Islands and near Middleton Island (ADF&G, 2005). These fish then migrate toward feeding grounds during summer, with distribution strongly influenced by ontogeny (Bailey, 2000). While their overall range is quite large there is significant patchiness in their distribution as a result of their tendency to school (Bailey, 2000).

Pollock return to the same place to spawn each year - typically occurs in deep indentations or canyons along the continental shelf (although they have been known to spawn in deep water bays as well) where they form large spawning aggregations (Bailey, 2000) (ADF&G, 2005). Eggs deposited between 100 and 400 meters but when they hatch the larvae move toward the surface where they occupy shallower depths—20 to 60 meters—and exhibit diel vertical migration (DVM) (Bailey, 2005). Pollock grow quickly, maturing by age 4 at around 40–45 cm, and can live up to 20 years, reaching lengths of 75 cm (Bailey, 2000). 

Pollock are considered an r-selected species and can occupy an extensive set of habitats (Bailey, 2000) They can be found in benthic, demersal, and pelagic zones depending on age, season, and local conditions (Bailey, 2000). They do appear to prefer temperatures between 2–6°C as adults, but juveniles are known to tolerate a much wider range — up to 12°C (Miyashita, 2004) (Duffy-Anderson, 2003). This flexibility contributes to their success in the variable environments of the North Pacific.

Pollock are mid-level predators. They consume euphausiids, copepods, amphipods, and small fish—sometimes engaging in intense cannibalism, particularly in winter and autumn, when juveniles can make up 80% of stomach contents (Bailey, 2000). Juveniles feed both day and night, largely following the diel cycle of their prey, while adults typically feed during daylight (Miyashita, 2004) although this seems to vary by region (Adams, 2007). This foraging behavior is a key factor in their depth use and movement.

Depth occupancy in pollock is highly structured and age-dependent while also being quite variable. Juveniles exhibit pronounced DVM, likely balancing foraging needs with predation risk—including from cannibalistic adults (Schwartzman, 1994). In the EBS, they tend to remain above the thermocline, in part due to their broader thermal tolerance (Duffy-Anderson, 2003) but also as an cannibalism avoidance strategy as adults typically occupy water below the thermocline (Schwartzman, 1994). Indeed their tends to be strong age based stratification in the EBS (Duffy-Anderson, 2003) but less stratification in the GOA where cannibalism is less of an issue (Adams, 2007). In contrast, adult depth behavior is more variable and influenced by metabolism, body condition, temperature, and food availability. While some studies found little evidence of diel migration in adults (Schwartzman, 1994), others observed vertical movement tied to prey like euphausiids, particularly in spring and summer (Adams, 2007) (Bailey, 2000). In these seasons, adult pollock may rise to within 20 meters of the surface at night in the GOA. During other times, such as November, they remain at greater depths and seem to be relying on different prey (Adams, 2007).

Seasonally pollock are known to occupy shallower waters just prior and just after spawning and this may be a result of both migration to shallower waters to spawn and then a need to quickly regain body condition after spawning (Kooka, 1998). After this the fish will move offshore and into deeper waters (Kooka, 1998) (ADF&G, 2005). Schwartzman (1994) also found that larger biomass schools were associated with shallower waters (<120m) and that average school depth increased with bottom depth, suggesting a dynamic link between aggregation size, depth, and oceanography.

Taken together, adult pollock exhibit a wide behavioral range: they may be demersal, pelagic, vertically migrating, or stationary at depth, depending on season, temperature, food availability, body condition, and intra-species dynamics. This variability is key in understanding their ecological role and the challenges of modeling their distribution and behavior.
