Chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) exhibit broad, dynamic marine distributions shaped by their natal origin and life history (Weitkamp, 2010). As an anadromous species, Chinook begin their lives in freshwater, where they rear for 0 to 2 years before migrating to the ocean. There, they spend 1 to 4 years feeding and growing before returning—often with remarkable fidelity—to their birth rivers to spawn (Trudel, 2009). Migration timing varies geographically: spring-run Chinook dominate in Alaska, while fall-run fish are common south of 56°N, with the exception of summer runs in the Fraser and Columbia Rivers (Trudel, 2009). Winter runs also occur in Oregon and California.

Our understanding of their marine distribution comes primarily from two sources: recoveries of fish implanted with coded wire tags (CWTs) (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010) and genetic stock identification of bycatch in marine fisheries (Guthrie, 2020). In general these studies have revealed remarkable variability in migration patterns across stocks and regions. Fish from Gulf of Alaska hatcheries have been recovered as far south as Oregon and as far west as the Aleutian Basin, illustrating an expansive but patchy distribution (Guthrie, 2020). Importantly, these distributions are strongly tied to natal stream origin. A clear latitudinal cline is evident: fish from northern hatcheries tend to stay and move farther north than those from southern systems (Weitkamp, 2010).

Generally, spring- and summer-run fish are recovered farther from their natal rivers than fall-run fish, although there are exceptions (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010). In regions like British Columbia, Puget Sound, and southern Oregon–northern California, run types show minimal differences in distribution (Weitkamp, 2010). Age also plays a role: recovery patterns for ocean age-1 fish differ from those at ages 2, 3, or 4 (Weitkamp, 2010). Regardless of where a fish may be found during its ocean phase, all Chinook return to their natal stream to spawn, often completing vast migrations in the process.

Genetic data from bycatch samples reinforce these patterns while revealing seasonal variation. In the Bering Sea pollock fishery, stock composition of Chinook bycatch shifts across the year: Western Alaska fish dominate in fall and winter but decline in spring and summer (Guthrie, 2020). Conversely, fish from California and Southeast Alaska appear primarily in the spring and summer.

Across all studies, Chinook tend to remain shelf-oriented, occupying coastal waters rather than dispersing into open-ocean basins (Seitz, 2024) (Weitkamp, 2010) — unlike species such as pink, chum, or sockeye salmon that are more pelagic.

Fish from Gulf of Alaska stocks present an interesting counterpoint to these general trends. Although they are most commonly recovered in the GOA, they are far less common there than fish from Southeast Alaska and British Columbia (Guthrie, 2020) — even though all three groups have similar run sizes. This suggests that GOA fish may migrate off-shelf into the broader North Pacific (Guthrie, 2020). 

However, it’s important to note that this entire picture is filtered through fisheries-dependent data. Because most insights come from fish recovered as bycatch, our understanding is limited to areas where fishing occurs (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010) (Seitz, 2024). We know little about Chinook distribution in unfished or lightly fished habitats, including potentially important but under-sampled coastal or offshore regions (Seitz, 2024). Additionally, both CWT and genetic data typically resolve fish origin at broad scales—by natal region, run timing, or age class—leaving significant gaps in our knowledge of fine-scale movements and substock structure in the ocean.

Chinook salmon’s marine life, in short, reflects a blend of predictability and plasticity: consistent life history anchors like natal homing and run timing are layered with complex, stock-specific marine migrations that unfold across vast, dynamic habitats.
### Outline

The overall point I'd like to make here is that the distributions are very very broad, hold to some general patterns, but point to large scale movements throughout the lives of the Chinook. And that it is very dependent on where the fish are from. 

- An understanding of Chinook movement has to start with a reference to their overall lifecycle. They are an anadromous species that rears initially in freshwater for 0 - 2 years before heading into the marine environment for the rest of their lives before maturing and then returning to spawn, almost always in the river they were born. Mature Chinook salmon may return to their natal river within their first or second year at sea as minijacks or jacks, respectively, though the majority of Chinook salmon return after spending 2–4 years at sea 
- As a result fish ages are designated by how long they were in the freshwater environment followed by how long they've been in the marine environment. 
- Beyond this fish are usually divided up by their run type - spring, summer, or fall. The spawning migration of mature Chinook salmon occurs at nearly any time of the year, depending on their geographic distribution: spring runs (hereafter, spring Chinook salmon) predominate in Alaska, whereas fall runs (hereafter, fall Chinook salmon) are almost exclusively distributed south of 568N, where they predominate in all runs except those of the Fraser River (British Columbia) and the Columbia River (Washington–Oregon), in which spring and summer runs are highly abundant (Major et al. 1978; Healey 1983; Waples et al. 2004). In addition, winter runs occur in Oregon and California.
- Most of what we presently know about their distribution is as a result of coded wire tags (would be good to describe that) and genetics on fish caught as bycatch.
- There is quite a lot of variability in the actual migration patterns and distribution as decoded from coded wire tag data
	- Widespread but patchy distribution of Gulf of Alaska stocks Coded-wire tags from Gulf of Alaska stocks have been recovered from Oregon to the Aleutian Basin, indicating that the area of distribution for these stocks is quite large.
	- Marine distribution patterns for the 77 HRGs indicate a clear latitudinal cline: tagged Chinook salmon released from northern hatcheries had more northern distributions than those from southern hatcheries
	- Chinook salmon from Alaskan hatcheries (HRGs 1–5) were largely recovered in Alaska, few recoveries occurring south of Alaska; (2) salmon originating from hatcheries in northern British Columbia to the Oregon coast (HRGs 6–69) were widely dispersed and recovered from the home recovery area (in which the natal stream enters the ocean) north to Southeast Alaska; and (3) Chinook salmon from hatcheries in southern Oregon and California (HRGs 70–77) were rarely caught north of the Columbia River (ColumR) recovery area.
	- tendency for spring or summer run types to be recovered farther from the home recovery area than fall run types from the same region is also apparent in mean recovery distance, which was significantly lower in fall-type HRGs (mean ¼ 225 km) than either spring (380 km) or summer (342 km) run types from the same region (KW H  6.7; P , 0.05). In other cases, there was little variation in recovery patterns for different run types within common release regions; recovery patterns for spring and summer Chinook salmon from northern British Columbia were quite similar, as were those for spring, summer, and fall Chinook salmon from Puget Sound, and spring and fall Chinook salmon from southern Oregon–northern California
	- For the Northwest Bering “B” season stratum, 66% of the stock composition was estimated to be from Alaska river systems flowing into the Bering Sea. The largest contributor was Coastal Western Alaska (54%) followed by North Alaska Peninsula (6%) Thirty-four percent of the stock composition was estimated to be from southern regions, where the largest contributors were British Columbia (17%), West Coast US (7%) and Northwest GOA (6%). Approximately 80% of the “B” season stock composition estimates for the CVOA (80%) and Southeast Bering (82%) were from southern regions (Fig. 6, Appendix 2). The largest contributors were British Columbia (43%), West Coast US (27% for CVOA, 29% for Southeast Bering), and Coastal Southeast Alaska (5% for CVOA, 6% for Southeast Bering. The only contributor from the Bering Sea was Coastal Western Alaska at 19% for CVOA, and 17% for Southeast Bering.
	- It seems that fish from the GOA typically leave the shelf for the broader waters of the Northern Pacific Ocean but that as you move further west the fish become increasingly Russian in their origin. Estimates from the Gulf of Alaska geographic stratum were almost completely composed of stocks from California to Southeast Alaska (Table 4; Fig. 3a). Despite their geographic proximity to the sampling area, relatively low contributions were estimated for stocks from the Gulf of Alaska, contrasting the general trend observed for most other stock-groups. The small estimates for the Gulf of Alaska reporting group compared with the Southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia reporting group in this region were not simply a reflection of differences in relative production, because both of these broadscale reporting groups have run sizes of similar magnitude.
- It's also clear that the fish continue to move throughout their life cycle - "analysis indicated that recovery patterns of ocean age-1 salmon were distinct from those at ages 2, 3 and 4, as were those between ages 2 and 4"
- There are also seasonal movements that have been observed: In the eastern Bering Sea shelf, stocks from coastal western Alaska and the North Alaska Peninsula made up a large proportion of mixtures from winter and fall but a much smaller proportion of mixtures from late spring and summer (Table 4; Fig. 3b). The decrease in proportions of these stocks in late spring and summer corresponded to an increase in stocks from the North Pacific Ocean
- In general it seems they tend to stay near the shelf. Tagging studies have shown there was a tendency for tagged fish to occupy the continental shelf from roughly 165–130°W, during all months of the year. These results highlight the importance of this coastal shelf habitat in the GOA for Chinook salmon growth. Occupation of this region by tagged Chinook salmon corroborates past research that suggests that this species is more coastally-oriented than other species of Pacific salmon such as pink salmon (O. gorbuscha), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and chum salmon (O. keta) that tend to occupy basin waters far from the coast (Seitz, 2024)
- Finally it should be noted that because all of this is based on CWT (coded wire tags) or genetics based on bycatch that this is all dependent upon fisheries dependent data - and that means a couple of things
	- We only know the general extent not really the distribution of the fish as it is dependent on fishing effort
	- Furthermore we only know about the areas in which fishing was happening, not where it wasn't. And that includes habitats as much as it includes habitats. 
	- We don't also have a good sense of how these general patterns turn into actual movements and substocks beyond the run timing and natal stream of the fish.

### Genetics

Estimates from the Gulf of Alaska geographic stratum were almost completely composed of stocks from California to Southeast Alaska (Table 4; Fig. 3a). Despite their geographic proximity to the sampling area, relatively low contributions were estimated for stocks from the Gulf of Alaska, contrasting the general trend observed for most other stock-groups. (Larson, 2013)

Coastal western Alaska stocks (i.e., Bristol Bay, Kuskokwim River, lower Yukon River, and Norton Sound) were the most prevalent stocks encountered in the Bering Sea, composing approximately 60% of mixtures from this area (Table 4; Figs. 3b, 3c, 3d). Southern stocks from California to Southeast Alaska and stocks from the North Alaska Peninsula were found in relatively high proportions in the eastern Bering Sea shelf but did not contribute significantly to estimates from any other Bering Sea regions (Larson, 2013)

In the eastern Bering Sea shelf, stocks from coastal western Alaska and the North Alaska Peninsula made up a large proportion of mixtures from winter and fall but a much smaller proportion of mixtures from late spring and summer (Table 4; Fig. 3b). The decrease in proportions of these stocks in late spring and summer corresponded to an increase in stocks from the North Pacific Ocean (mostly fish from California to Southeast Alaska) during this time period. These seasonal patterns were temporally stable across multiple years. (Larson, 2013)

The substantial presence of middle and upper Yukon River stocks on the central Bering Sea shelf during winter and fall contrasted with much smaller estimates for this reporting group in the summer (Table 4; Fig. 3c). An opposite pattern was observed with more southern stocks from California to Southeast Alaska, which were present in moderate numbers on the central Bering Sea shelf during summer but were nearly undetected in the fall and winter (Table 4). (Larson, 2013)

Widespread but patchy distribution of Gulf of Alaska stocks Coded-wire tags from Gulf of Alaska stocks have been recovered from Oregon to the Aleutian Basin, indicating that the area of distribution for these stocks is quite large. Despite this range, we detected only occasional and relatively small contributions from these stocks in our mixture samples. As expected, contributions from Gulf of Alaska stocks were the largest in our Gulf of Alaska geographic stratum, but they were still relatively small compared with those of Southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia stocks. The small estimates for the Gulf of Alaska reporting group compared with the Southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia reporting group in this region were not simply a reflection of differences in relative production, because both of these broadscale reporting groups have run sizes of similar magnitude. (Larson, 2013)

Concordance varies for our estimates and those derived from scale pattern analysis (Myers et al. 1987; Myers and Rogers 1988). Estimates were highly concordant for mixtures from the central Bering Sea basin summer but were increasingly divergent for mixtures from the eastern Bering Sea shelf fall and western Bering Sea summer (Myers et al. 1987; Myers and Rogers 1988). In the western Bering Sea, evidence from scale pattern analyses suggests considerable interannual variation in the relative proportions of immature Russian stocks during the past five decades, possibly related to variation in year-class strength of these stocks, as well as variation in distribution and abundance of the Chinook salmon forage base (Larson, 2013)
### Tagging

In general, Chinook salmon rear in freshwater for up to two years before they migrate to the ocean to feed for generally one to five years. After their ocean phase when they grow to adults, Chinook salmon return to their natal river to spawn once and then die. (Seitz, 2024)

While in the ocean, relatively little is known about the migration and behavior of Chinook salmon, despite the fact that individuals frequently reside in the ocean for the majority of their lives (Brodeur et al. 2000; Drenner et al. 2012; Riddell et al. 2018) (Seitz, 2024)

Currently, based on coded wire tag (CWT) recoveries, genetic analyses, and bycatch in groundfish fisheries, large spatial overlap exists in the oceanic distributions of many populations of Chinook salmon originating from North America (Seitz, 2024)

However, there are many details about the migration of this species that are unknown, as most of what is known about Chinook salmon occurrence in the GOA, particularly outside of State of Alaska waters (>5.6 km), is dependent on incidental captures in groundfish trawl fisheries, which are not conducted in a spatially and temporally uniform manner throughout the GOA (Seitz, 2024)

As a result, spatial and temporal information about Chinook salmon is biased and it does not exist throughout the species’ entire range, which extends beyond where groundfish fisheries occur. (Seitz, 2024)

Most likely movement paths (n = 111)1 suggested that, regardless of time at liberty, even with tag durations up to 260 days, the majority (n = 79) of tagged Chinook salmon remained near (<500 km displacement) their tagging sites (Table 2; Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In contrast to the majority of tags that were inferred to have remained near the tagging regions, 32 tagged Chinook salmon demonstrated extensive movements (>500 km) across the NPO (Seitz, 2024)

While occupying waters of the NPO, regardless of deployment region, 70% (78 of 111) of end locations and 57% of daily locations (4,264 out of 7,522 days of position estimates) were <50 km from land (Fig. 8) and over seafloor depths of generally <200 m. (Seitz, 2024)

Reporting locations of tags suggest that mortality of tagged Chinook salmon was geographically widespread, from the western extent of the Alaska Peninsula to the U.S. PNW (Seitz, 2024)

During this study there was a tendency for tagged fish to occupy the continental shelf from roughly 165–130°W, during all months of the year. These results highlight the importance of this coastal shelf habitat in the GOA for Chinook salmon growth. Occupation of this region by tagged Chinook salmon corroborates past research that suggests that this species is more coastally-oriented than other species of Pacific salmon such as pink salmon (O. gorbuscha), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and chum salmon (O. keta) that tend to occupy basin waters far from the coast (Seitz, 2024)

Tagged fish in this study were all from stock-origins south of central Alaska, similar to stock composition estimates of Chinook salmon incidentally captured in groundfish fisheries in the GOA, which are predominately comprised of British Columbia, U.S. PNW, and coastal Southeast Alaska populations (Seitz, 2024)

The tendency of many tagged fish to remain in the region in which they were tagged is likely representative of tagging immature Chinook salmon that still have an additional year or more of feeding at sea before swimming back to their natal origins (Seitz, 2024)

However, as noted by (Courtney et al. 2019), these observations are in direct contrast to behavior patterns found in the southern end of this species’ range, off the coast of Oregon and northern California, where Chinook salmon appeared to seasonally adjust their vertical position in the water to almost exclusively occupy a narrow range of water temperatures (8–12°C) during all seasons of the year (Seitz, 2024)

These findings are corroborated by previous CWT recoveries and satellite tagging research in the GOA, all of which suggest that Navy training activities that occur over basin waters of the TMAA are less likely to co-occur with this species, compared to other areas of the TMAA (Seitz, 2024)

The persistent temperature experiences illustrated in Fig. 2 were representative of the temperature experiences of all the fish considered here. All tags measured a similarly narrow range of temperatures through time, and this was reflected in similar rates of temperature accumulation for all 25 Chinook (Fig. 3A). Regardless of year (2000 or 2003), month of release (February to September), location of release (Fig. 1), length at release (range = 57 to 80 cm fork length, mean = 69 cm FL), or location of recapture (Fig. 1), the rates of temperature accumulation (the slopes of each line) were similar, even for tags that recorded up to 15 mo of continuous observations (Fig. 3A). Note, however, that the temperatures used by Chinook salmon are not the same at any given point in time, and the resulting temperature accumulations of all individuals are neither linear nor parallel (Fig. 3A). Nonetheless, a variance components model indicated that there was negligible individual or monthly variation in the temperatures used by the 4 Chinook salmon that overwintered at sea (Table 3). (Hinke, 2005)

Irrespective of the date of release, all Chinook salmon generally experienced temperatures that were similar to SSTs at all buoys throughout the study area. (Hinke, 2005)

As times at liberty extended into August and September for Tags 291, 1200 and 1994, the temperature accumulations at the buoys near release locations (Fig. 4I–L) and buoys near recovery locations (Fig. 4C,E,J) diverged from temperature accumulations of the fish. (Hinke, 2005)

As SSTs warmed beyond 12°C in early autumn, depth use increased (Fig. 11). Finally, the deepest habitats were used during the period of lowest SCCs from December through February, and the use of shallower habitats resumed as SCCs increased during the spring months (Fig. 11). (Hinke, 2005)

### CWT 

Although a number of factors may be responsible for the decline of the southern stocks, the simultaneous decline of salmon originating from geographically distant watersheds suggests that a common cause is affecting these stocks in the marine environment (Trudel, 2009)

Although it is fairly well established that juvenile Pacific salmon generally undertake a northward migration along the continental shelf (Hartt and Dell 1986; Groot and Margolis 1991; Pearcy 1992), the extent of the spatial and seasonal variations in the distribution of juvenile salmon from different stocks is poorly known for most stocks (Trudel, 2009)

Seaward migration of Chinook salmon smolts can take place within a few months after their emergence from gravel (i.e., as subyearlings) or after completing a full year in freshwater (i.e., as yearlings). Mature Chinook salmon may return to their natal river within their first or second year at sea as minijacks or jacks, respectively, though the majority of Chinook salmon return after spending 2–4 years at sea (Healey 1991). The spawning migration of mature Chinook salmon occurs at nearly any time of the year, depending on their geographic distribution: spring runs (hereafter, spring Chinook salmon) predominate in Alaska, whereas fall runs (hereafter, fall Chinook salmon) are almost exclusively distributed south of 568N, where they predominate in all runs except those of the Fraser River (British Columbia) and the Columbia River (Washington–Oregon), in which spring and summer runs are highly abundant (Major et al. 1978; Healey 1983; Waples et al. 2004). In addition, winter runs occur in Oregon and California. Spring and fall Chinook salmon smolts typically migrate to sea as yearlings and subyearlings (Healey 1991), respectively, though alternative seaward migratory tactics have been reported for wild fall Chinook salmon (Connor et al. 2002, 2005). (Trudel, 2009)

The migratory behavior of Chinook salmon has primarily been investigated using coded wire tag (CWT) recovery data obtained from immature and mature fish caught in commercial and recreational fisheries (Healey 1983, 1991) as well as from Chinook salmon tagged at sea (Trudel, 2009)

However, the number of tagged fish recovered relative to the number released varied tenfold among production areas (Trudel, 2009)

‘Stream-type’’ Chinook salmon produce fry that remain in freshwater for one or more years before migrating to sea and are believed to undertake a rapid and extensive migration along the continental shelf, then rear in offshore waters before returning to their natal rivers in the spring and summer of subsequent years to spawn. (Trudel, 2009)

‘‘Ocean-type’’ Chinook salmon, which migrate to sea as subyearlings after rearing in freshwater for a few weeks or months, are believed to establish residence on the continental shelf before returning to their natal rivers in the summer and fall of subsequent years to spawn. (Trudel, 2009)

The analyses performed in this study indicate that the migratory behavior of juvenile Chinook salmon we observed did not conform to the stream-type and ocean-type classifications proposed by Healey (Trudel, 2009)

Our analyses also showed that the northward migration of coastal stocks was initiated during their second year at sea for Southeast Alaska, Washington, and Oregon stocks or possibly during their third year at sea for west coast of Vancouver Island stocks, whereas Salish Sea stocks primarily migrated out of the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound after their first year at sea, as CPUE increased by a factor of 3–4 between ocean ages 0 and 1 for these stocks. (Trudel, 2009)

Columbia River spring Chinook salmon did not establish residence on the continental shelf. Instead, they appeared to leave the continental shelf sometime late in the summer or in the fall, as CPUE decreased by a factor of ten between summer and fall and very few Columbia River spring Chinook salmon were recovered on the continental shelf during their second year at sea or reached the continental shelf off of the Bering Sea or Aleutian Archipelago. However, the data collected in this study are insufficient to determine where the northern migrants leave the continental shelf, as sampling in central Alaska and the Aleutian Islands was limited during both summer and fall and no sampling occurred in this region during winter. (Trudel, 2009)

In addition to the northern migrants, a fraction of the Columbia River spring and fall Chinook salmon migrated south of the Columbia River. Fisher and Pearcy (1995) argued that southern migrants had been advected south of the Columbia River by strong southward flows. The results obtained in this study also suggest that this southward migration was, at least in part, active. (Trudel, 2009)

Coded wire tags were particularly useful in this study of the migratory behavior of juvenile Chinook salmon, as they provide unequivocal information as to fish origins. However, the low recovery rate of tagged fish (approximately six per million releases) precluded interannual comparisons of juvenile Chinook salmon migratory behavior as well as the inclusion of stocks for which relatively few tagged fish are released, (Trudel, 2009)

Coded wire tags were particularly useful in this study of the migratory behavior of juvenile Chinook salmon, as they provide unequivocal information as to fish origins. However, the low recovery rate of tagged fish (approximately six per million releases) precluded interannual comparisons of juvenile Chinook salmon migratory behavior as well as the inclusion of stocks for which relatively few tagged fish are released, (Trudel, 2009)

The appropriate spatial scale for Columbia River spring Chinook salmon is currently difficult to determine owing to the diversity of migratory behavior and ocean entry timing observed in these fish, with both fast and slow northward migrants, southern migrants, and late and early migrants (Trudel, 2009)

Historically, the marine phase of the life cycle of Pacific salmon has often been treated as a black box, the assumption being that the marine environment is homogeneous. Yet the ocean conditions experienced by Pacific salmon are highly heterogeneous both in space and time (Trudel, 2009)

Knowing the spatial dynamics of an organismwhere it is located during each stage of its life—is crucial to understanding the factors affecting its survival and reproductive success (Weitkamp, 2010)

Despite its widespread use by managers, however, it is difficult to construct a coastwide picture of marine distributions from these studies because of their often limited geographic range, use of recovery areas based on fishery type rather than geographic area, and lack of a common methodology (Weitkamp, 2010)

Marine distribution patterns for the 77 HRGs indicate a clear latitudinal cline: tagged Chinook salmon released from northern hatcheries had more northern distributions than those from southern hatcheries (Figures 2, 3). However, the distribution of fish across recovery areas followed three broad patterns based on release region: (1) Chinook salmon from Alaskan hatcheries (HRGs 1–5) were largely recovered in Alaska, few recoveries occurring south of Alaska; (2) salmon originating from hatcheries in northern British Columbia to the Oregon coast (HRGs 6–69) were widely dispersed and recovered from the home recovery area (in which the natal stream enters the ocean) north to Southeast Alaska; and (3) Chinook salmon from hatcheries in southern Oregon and California (HRGs 70–77) were rarely caught north of the Columbia River (ColumR) recovery area. (Weitkamp, 2010)

This tendency for spring or summer run types to be recovered farther from the home recovery area than fall run types from the same region is also apparent in mean recovery distance, which was significantly lower in fall-type HRGs (mean ¼ 225 km) than either spring (380 km) or summer (342 km) run types from the same region (KW H  6.7; P , 0.05). In other cases, there was little variation in recovery patterns for different run types within common release regions; recovery patterns for spring and summer Chinook salmon from northern British Columbia were quite similar, as were those for spring, summer, and fall Chinook salmon from Puget Sound, and spring and fall Chinook salmon from southern Oregon–northern California (Weitkamp, 2010)

The ANOSIM was used to test for differences in recovery patterns based on release region and run type. Using the 15 release regions (Table A.1), both factors formed better groups than would be expected by chance, release region creating better separated groups (global R ¼ 0.85; P , 0.01) than run type (global R ¼ 0.36; P , 0.01). (Weitkamp, 2010)

By run type, ANOSIM indicated that spring runs had distinct recovery patterns from both summer and fall runs (R ¼ 0.38; P , 0.05), while summer and fall run types did not form well-separated groups (R ¼ 0.10; P . 0.10). (Weitkamp, 2010)

The analysis indicated that recovery patterns of ocean age-1 salmon were distinct from those at ages 2, 3 and 4, as were those between ages 2 and 4 (Table 6). (Weitkamp, 2010)

Little interannual change in marine distributions suggest that Chinook salmon distributions are driven to a larger degree by genetic control of migration (Brannon and Setter 1989; KallioNyberg and Ikonen 1992) than by either local environmental conditions (Hodgson et al. 2006) or opportunistic foraging opportunities (Weitkamp, 2010)

Analysis of tagged Rogue River Chinook salmon released from the Columbia River indicates that only 9% of these fish were recovered north of the Columbia River recovery area compared with 87% for native Columbia-origin Chinook salmon (HRGs 49–65; Figure 2). Because the two groups enter the ocean at the same location and time (RMIS), the difference suggests considerable genetic control of marine distributions. (Weitkamp, 2010)

Instead, most (.90%) salmon chose to return to their natal stream (Healey 1991; Myers et al. 1998; Quinn 2005) and apparently know how to get there. (Weitkamp, 2010)

### Genetic Stock Composition

It is important to understand the stock composition of Pacific salmon caught in these fisheries, which take place in areas that are known feeding habitat for multiple brood years of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from many different localities in North America and Asia (Myers et al. 2007, Davis et al. 2009).  (Guthrie, 2020)

For the “B” season, stock composition estimates were developed for CVOA (320 samples, Fig. 5), Southeast Bering (291 samples, Fig. 8), and Northwest Bering (179 samples Fig. 8) (NMFS 2019). The Northwest and Southeast strata overlap with CVOA stratum. For the Northwest Bering “B” season stratum, 66% of the stock composition was estimated to be from Alaska river systems flowing into the Bering Sea. The largest contributor was Coastal Western Alaska (54%) followed by North Alaska Peninsula (6%) Thirty-four percent of the stock composition was estimated to be from southern regions, where the largest contributors were British Columbia (17%), West Coast US (7%) and Northwest GOA (6%). Approximately 80% of the “B” season stock composition estimates for the CVOA (80%) and Southeast Bering (82%) were from southern regions (Fig. 6, Appendix 2). The largest contributors were British Columbia (43%), West Coast US (27% for CVOA, 29% for Southeast Bering), and Coastal Southeast Alaska (5% for CVOA, 6% for Southeast Bering. The only contributor from the Bering Sea was Coastal Western Alaska at 19% for CVOA, and 17% for Southeast Bering. (Guthrie, 2020)

The estimated relative contributions from these more southern regions previously increased from a low of 20% in 2011 to a high of 86% in 2017, declining to 63% in 2018 (Guthrie, 2020)
