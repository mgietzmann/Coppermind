Chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) exhibit broad, dynamic marine distributions shaped by their natal origin and life history (Weitkamp, 2010). As an anadromous species, Chinook begin their lives in freshwater, where they rear for 0 to 2 years before migrating to the ocean. There, they spend 1 to 4 years feeding and growing before returning—often with remarkable fidelity—to their birth rivers to spawn (Trudel, 2009). Migration timing varies geographically: spring-run Chinook dominate in Alaska, while fall-run fish are common south of 56°N, with the exception of summer runs in the Fraser and Columbia Rivers (Trudel, 2009). Winter runs also occur in Oregon and California.

Our understanding of their marine distribution comes primarily from two sources: recoveries of fish implanted with coded wire tags (CWTs) (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010) and genetic stock identification of bycatch in marine fisheries (Larson, 2013). In general these studies have revealed remarkable variability in migration patterns across stocks and regions. Fish from Gulf of Alaska hatcheries have been recovered as far south as Oregon and as far west as the Aleutian Basin, illustrating an expansive but patchy distribution (Larson, 2013). Importantly, these distributions are strongly tied to natal stream origin. A clear latitudinal cline is evident: fish from northern hatcheries tend to stay and move farther north than those from southern systems (Weitkamp, 2010).

Generally, spring- and summer-run fish are recovered farther from their natal rivers than fall-run fish, although there are exceptions (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010). In regions like British Columbia, Puget Sound, and southern Oregon–northern California, run types show minimal differences in distribution (Weitkamp, 2010). Age also plays a role: recovery patterns for ocean age-1 fish differ from those at ages 2, 3, or 4 (Weitkamp, 2010). Regardless of where a fish may be found during its ocean phase, all Chinook return to their natal stream to spawn, often completing vast migrations in the process.

Genetic data from bycatch samples reinforce these patterns while revealing seasonal variation. In the Bering Sea pollock fishery, stock composition of Chinook bycatch shifts across the year: Western Alaska fish dominate in fall and winter but decline in spring and summer (Larson, 2013). Conversely, fish from California and Southeast Alaska appear primarily in the spring and summer.

Across all studies, Chinook tend to remain shelf-oriented, occupying coastal waters rather than dispersing into open-ocean basins (Seitz, 2024) (Weitkamp, 2010) — unlike species such as pink, chum, or sockeye salmon that are more pelagic.

Fish from Gulf of Alaska stocks present an interesting counterpoint to these general trends. Although they are most commonly recovered in the GOA, they are far less common there than fish from Southeast Alaska and British Columbia (Larson, 2013) — even though all three groups have similar run sizes. This suggests that GOA fish may migrate off-shelf into the broader North Pacific (Larson, 2013). 

However, it’s important to note that this entire picture is filtered through fisheries-dependent data. Because most insights come from fish recovered as bycatch, our understanding is limited to areas where fishing occurs (Trudel, 2009) (Weitkamp, 2010) (Seitz, 2024). We know little about Chinook distribution in unfished or lightly fished habitats, including potentially important but under-sampled coastal or offshore regions (Seitz, 2024). Additionally, both CWT and genetic data typically resolve fish origin at broad scales—by natal region, run timing, or age class—leaving significant gaps in our knowledge of fine-scale movements and substock structure in the ocean.

Chinook salmon’s marine life, in short, reflects a blend of predictability and plasticity: consistent life history anchors like natal homing and run timing are layered with complex, stock-specific marine migrations that unfold across vast, dynamic habitats.
