Fisheries management employs a range of strategies to reduce bycatch and mitigate the ecological impacts of fishing. Many of these strategies operate by placing explicit limits on bycatch species, such as setting quotas or implementing fishery-wide closures when bycatch thresholds are exceeded. Others may prohibit fishing in areas where bycatch risk is consistently high. While these measures can successfully limit total bycatch, they do so by restricting fishing effort rather than by necessarily improving fishing selectivity (Dunn, 2011).

Improving selectivity — the ability to catch target species while avoiding non-target species or life stages — provides opportunities for keeping bycatch at sustainable levels without necessarily reducing overall fishing effort. Gear modifications provide one approach to increasing selectivity, but another strategy that is gaining increasing traction is time/area closures (Dunn, 2011)(Gauvin, 1995).

Time/area closures restrict fishing activity in ways that are bounded in both space and time. The simplest form is a periodic closure, applied each fishing season at a pre-arranged time in areas associated with critical life history events such as spawning aggregations, nursery habitats, or migratory bottlenecks. These closures are intended to protect vulnerable species or life stages during times when they are most at risk of capture.

However, bycatch risk is not always so predictable or periodic. Dynamic or event-triggered closures are used in cases where bycatch risk is episodic or driven by shifting environmental conditions (Woods, 2017). These closures are enacted in response to observed bycatch events often through real-time monitoring or fleet communication systems (Dunn, 2011). Some programs rely on top-down regulatory actions (Woods, 2017), while others are implemented voluntarily by industry groups seeking to avoid hard closures or quota overages (Dunn, 2014).

The effectiveness of any closure—whether static or dynamic—depends on careful design and an understanding of the biological and behavioral patterns of the species involved (Dunn, 2011). Periodic closures require detailed knowledge of the timing and location of spawning, nursery use, or migration, as well as the spatial and temporal extent necessary to provide meaningful protection (Crear, 2021)(O'Keefe, 2014)(Woods, 2017). Dynamic closures add additional complexity, as managers must determine how long an aggregation will persist, how large an area should be closed, and whether bycatch risk is truly localized (O'Keefe, 2014)(Woods, 2017). In some cases, such as with highly mobile or dispersed species, event-triggered closures may offer little benefit if the fish do not show clear spatial patterning or disperse very quickly (O'Keefe, 2014)(Munehara, 2021)(Crear, 2021)(Woods, 2017)(Gauvin, 1995). Failure to properly take these considerations into account has led to closure programs that have been criticized as ineffective (Woods, 2017)(O'Keefe, 2014). 

In either case it is important to also consider the side effects of closures whether that be unintended changes in the population dynamics due to increased levels of predators (O'Keefe, 2014) or shifts in fishing pressure in other areas (Dunn, 2011)(Needle, 2011). 

Defining and implementing effective closures also requires reliable data. Event-triggered closures rely on rapid reporting of bycatch events (Woods, 2017)(Dunn, 2014), while periodic closures require long-term information on habitat use and movement patterns (Crear, 2021)(O'Keefe, 2014). Both types of closures can reduce the availability of data once in place, complicating evaluation of their effectiveness (Crear, 2021)(Needle, 2011)(O'Keefe, 2014). Furthermore compliance with closures can only be determined if there are systems in place for identifying vessel locations and activity (Needle, 2011). 

Despite these challenges, time/area closures have been shown to reduce bycatch and improve fleet outcomes in a range of fisheries. Real time closures (RTCs) showed ecological effectiveness in the Icelandic haddock and herring fisheries (Woods, 2017). The Sea State programme has had success in providing day to day information on spatial bycatch patterns using voluntary data from mixed species fisheries in Alaska and has reportedly saved the participating fleets millions of dollars by extending fishing seasons (Gauvin, 1995). The closures in the shrimp trawl fleet in Kuwait have also been reported as successful in reducing bycatch (O'Keefe, 2014) and TurtleWatch is a well known example of how these kinds of voluntary closure programs can be quite power when there is engagement from the fleets (O'Keefe, 2014). Moreover, in voluntary closure programs, the continued participation of fishers also suggests that these measures can be effective and well-received when implemented collaboratively.

Not all cases are success stories. Of the four fisheries examined by Woods et. al (2017) two didn't show signs of improvement. There are also closure programs in place for Sea Lions in New Zealand and juvenile plaice in the North sea that have had limited if any impact (O'Keefe, 2014). But these case studies highlight the importance of matching the strategy used to the ecology and fishery in question (Woods, 2017)(O'Keefe, 2014). 

Ultimately, the success of time/area closures depends on their ability to align with the underlying movement dynamics and behavior of both target and non-target species. Without this foundation, closures risk being either too broad, imposing unnecessary economic costs, or too narrow, failing to achieve their ecological objectives. As dynamic management tools become more sophisticated and data availability improves, time/area closures will continue to play a central role in efforts to balance sustainable harvest with ecological stewardship.
