### The Background on Bycatch Issues Writ Large

Overall [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]] is great in the sense that it goes over how to organize and think about bycatch mitigation strategies, but it doesn't really get into how to think about why you want to avoid bycatch in the first place and very briefly explores how you'd measure the good or bad impacts that come along with it. 

[[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]] is great for talking through the kinds of bycatch, why it happens, and why it's an issue. 

- Definition
- History
- Issues
- Kinds of solutions
- Need to consider human aspects
	- What are those aspects? (include all of it)
- A full mitigation strategy pulls all of this in

- Definition of bycatch
- History of bycatch (i.e. why it came into the scene)
- Reasons for why it was/is happening
- All the ways it's been determined to cause issues
- Kinds of goals
- Kinds of incentives (for both coming up with new strategies and keeping those strategies in play)
- Strategies
	- Process
	- Technology
- The play of information in all of this

I think the thing is to throw in some examples in each of these cases (or rather say - this is who is using what)

Then I can drop straight into the walleye pollock problem being X, Y, and Z in terms of the classification scheme above. 

The point of this blurb is really going to be to allow anyone to put their specific bycatch issue into context (and then through the context see wha else they can look into/are missing)

- I definitely need to start all of this with a definition of bycatch (and perhaps some history on how that has changed)
- Then the reasons for bycatch in the first place (why it happens and why people discard and the like)
- A little history would be nice here honestly
- Can also get into the classifications of how bycatch comes about (you need to know these kinds of things to deal with bycatch)
	- spatial
	- temporal
	- level of control
	- rare or common
	- predictability
	- ecological origin of the bycatch
	- level and type of impact
	- legal and economic considerations
- Then get into why this is harmful
- Dealing with bycatch comes in four forms (according to the MH)
	- Avoidance
	- Mitigation
		- Reduction in effort vs reduction in unselectivity [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
	- Restoration
	- Offsets 
- *Understanding the public good that comes out of this is one gap in my understanding right now*
- Where the first two are really the only ones that deal with "bycatch avoidance and mitigation"
- From there there are four ways (broadly speaking) of driving avoidance or mitigation
	- Private solutions
	- Direct regulation
	- Incentives
	- and Hybrid (which is more or less regulation combined with incentives - i.e. incentives only show up at a point)
- Each of these has its various benefits and disadvantages and largely deal with the degree of heterogeneity implicit in the fleet that's being dealt with
- But out of these have come a lot of different strategies for reducing bycatch (**fill this out**)
	- Process
	- Technology
- The important thing here is to appreciate this hierarchy of goals -> drivers -> solutions.
- But solutions can only be informed by information and so there is a great deal of interesting stuff to say about where information comes from and how folks build solutions
- *What we want to get it as that information is key in all of these cases*

I definitely need to include some notion of what's required to actually come up with a solution and then what's required to incentivize finding solutions and then incentivize using those solutions. 

One thing that's somewhat unclear to me is how to represent all of this succinctly but meaningfully. I'm getting the sense that throwing a few specific examples may be a good idea. 

What's missing right now very clearly are the outcomes and impacts side of things. 

I also think it's worth putting this as the "potentials" of bycatch issues as obviously if I write something on the state of bycatch _right now_ I can't reuse the text in a few years...

Components of our background
- Define bycatch
- There is an inclusion of habitat impact [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Bycatch divides into "inconvenient" and "forbidden"
- Conservation biology mitigation hierarchy [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Four regulatory categories for bycatch mitigation
	- private, direct regulation, incentive, and hybrid
- bycatch mitigation is highly dependent on the context [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- What we're doing goes toward the avoidance category [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
	- It would be useful to outline these categories **Indeed this is actually a pretty interesting thing to introduce early on**
- A nice list of current avoidance strategies [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Or it may fall into selectivity... 
- "The NNL objective can also lower social welfare if it restricts target catch to such an amount that the foregone social benefits out-weigh the social benefits of bycatch mitigation to NNL." [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Least cost bycatch reduction [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- So there are the steps of the conservation hierarchy and then there are the basic regulatory approaches (and we should go through these as well)
	- Private solutions
	- Direct regulation
	- Incentive-based measures
	- Hybrid solutions
- "Sundown sets" - what are these? Seems like this a cool and relevant example to what we're doing or at least are suggesting.
- Performance vs Process [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Deposit refund system for "ghost gear" [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]] - that's pretty cool!
- There are already examples of fishermen deploying nets at different times based on their own knowledge to try and avoid bycatch [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Alternative livelihoods as a bycatch reduction strategy [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- "Thus direct regulation does not impose responsibility upon the producers for any bycatch that might occur despite compliance with those regulations" [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- "In some instances, a large psychological effect can crowd out the economically incentivized behavior." [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Transboundary bycatch
- Who actually knows more? The management or the producers? [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
	- The need for at sea monitoring in many cases
- Hawaii Turtle Watch program [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]
- Producers tend to invent worse technology then could exist [[Squires et al. - 2021 - Mitigating Bycatch Novel Insights to Multidiscipl.pdf]]

#### Outcomes of Bycatch Itself

- Impacts on long lived species [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
- Impacts on food chains [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
- Waste of protein [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
- Conflicts between fishermen [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]] and different managed stocks effectively 
- Level of take unsustainable for bycatch species [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
	- That's us!
- Same species bycatch (juveniles or big ole fish) [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
- It generally just makes management a huge headache [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
- Just the sheer amount of bycatch is rather useful to talk about... 
- Prohibited species and high grading [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]

- Reasons for bycatch [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]
	- Fish caught are of the wrong species, size or sex, or the ®sh are damaged. · Fish are incompatible with the rest of the catch (from the point of view of storage). · Fish are poisonous. · Fish spoil rapidly (i.e. before it is brought on board). · Lack of space on board. · High grading. · Quotas reached. · The catch was of prohibited species, in prohibited season or ®shing ground, or with prohibited gear. 

- Interesting note on how selectivity used to apply just to sizes of a specific species and now has much broader usage [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]

- Bycatch is throwing stuff overboard (for usually economic reasons) and the retention of stuff you weren't targeting. 
- "Of particular interest is the case of Norway, which has adopted a policy of No discards'. Fishers are not allowed to discard anything caught in the net, and that forces them to ®sh selectively by avoiding periods, areas or times of the day with high by-catches, and by developing technology that contributes to that goal. Norway is the only country that has prohibited discards by law and ®shermen are obliged to bring all their catch ashore" [[By_Catch_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf]]

#### Social Benefits, Issues, and Complexities in Bycatch Mitigation

### Pulling the Bycatch Overview Together

- Bycatch is defined as any non-targeted take during fishing. 
- This means it includes species different from the ones targeted as well as different "non-marketable" or "unkeepable" life stages of the targeted species. 
- Beginning with public opinion about charismatic megafauna being taken in fishing operations, further research into the issue has illuminated a variety of issues that come from this unintentional catch. 
- These include: 
	- Waste of protein (and indeed the protein dumped overboard can end up in deep waters where it takes a long time to get mixed back into the normal ecosystem)
	- It can result in the unsustainable harvesting of a non-targeted species. 
	- It creates mortality that complicates management of the non-targeted species
	- It can end up effecting food web dynamics by reducing or removing predators or prey
	- It can create conflict between fishers in different fisheries 
	- It can cause the closing of fisheries in the case of take of prohibited species 
	- It can upset the population dynamics
- Bycatch in some sense is an implicit part of fishing as very few fishing methods can actually selectively target a single species and only marketable fish within that species. 
- However that does not mean there aren't solutions.
	- Solutions fall into effectively three categories - closures, fishing process changes, and technological changes. 
	- Closures are regulatory solutions that intend to stop fishing where bycatch is or is expected to become too high or after some quote for bycatch is reached. While this, if enforced, results in bycatch avoidance there are obvious consequences to the fishers themselves who no longer have access to certain areas/periods of time. 
	- Fishing process changes are another solution wherein fishers might change the way they fish to reduce bycatch. This would include such things as fishing during different periods of the day (or avoiding certain periods), voluntarily trawling for a short period to see if there is a large volume of bycatch and then switching where fishing is happening, or using other kinds of information to effectively avoid unwanted bycatch
	- Finally there are technological changes such as Turtle Excluder devices, grids in cod ends, switching the kinds of hooks, and so on. 
- In general these solutions result in either more targeted fishing or they just close down the fleet when some bycatch rate or limit is exceeded. Clearly the former has nasty impacts on the fishers themselves whereas more efficient methods of fishing can actually decrease the work involved. 
- Which all brings in the human side of this. Any bycatch solution really needs to consider both the ecological side of things and the human side of things. While a specific fishing strategy may be more targeted it may require new equipment or new operating procedures that are not easily afforded. Or it may reduce the overall efficiency of a fleet already dealing in shallow margins. Many times too there are issues with monitoring - especially ones that can cause closures and fishers may be reluctant to cooperate, especially if the efficacy of the mitigation strategy is unclear. Therefore, in order for a mitigation strategy to be successful it must consider both of these elements.

**Bycatch**—the unintentional capture of non-target organisms, including juvenile fish—is a persistent issue in many fisheries (Davies, 2009; Hall, 2000). While it first gained widespread public attention due to the incidental take of charismatic megafauna (Hall, 2000), subsequent research has illuminated a wide range of concerns. These include the waste of edible protein (Hall, 2000; Zeller., 2018), conflicts between fisheries targeting different species (Lomeli, 2021; NPFMC, 2022), increased extinction risk for vulnerable species such as sea turtles (Wallace, 2013) and cetaceans (D’Agrosa, 2000), trophic disruption through the removal of predators or prey (Estes., 2011), and broader destabilization of population dynamics (Hall, 2000). As a result, considerable attention has been directed toward reducing bycatch through both policy and innovation.

Mitigation strategies are highly context-dependent (Komoroske, 2015; Hall, 2000) and span a wide range of options due to the variability in problems across fisheries that target different species and due to the variability in vessel sizes, practices and gear within a single fishery (Squires, 2021). Regulatory approaches include time–area closures, limits on vessel size or trip length, and dynamic ocean management techniques that adjust spatial or temporal access in near real-time (Squires, 2021). These measures aim to reduce fishing effort in scenarios where bycatch is most likely or most harmful.

At the other end of the spectrum are technological interventions that improve targeting without necessarily reducing effort. Examples include bird-scaring lines (Maree et al., 2014), turtle excluder devices (Crowder et al., 1994), the Nordmøre grid used in shrimp trawls (Graham, 2006), and acoustic deterrents like pingers (Mangel, 2013).

Between these lie process-based adaptations that seek to reduce bycatch through changes in fishing behavior. These can involve shifting the time of day that fishing occurs (Hall, 2000; Squires, 2021), using experience-based knowledge to avoid areas of high bycatch likelihood, or modifying gear deployment patterns to identify safer fishing zones before committing fully (Squires, 2021).

Alongside these technical and regulatory solutions are the **incentive structures** designed to encourage both the adoption of known bycatch reduction methods and the development of new innovations. Squires et al. (2021) identify four broad categories: _private solutions_ (including voluntary measures and peer-driven persuasion), _direct regulation_ (relying on the capacity of management agencies to enforce rules), _incentive-based measures_ (where fishers receive direct rewards or benefits for reducing bycatch), and _hybrid approaches_ that combine regulatory frameworks with economic or social incentives.

However, the success of these strategies is not only a matter of design but also of perception. Their effectiveness and uptake are shaped by how fishers view the proposed measures, their trust in management authorities, and the anticipated social and economic impacts on their operations (Suuronen, 2002; Squires, 2021). Even well-crafted solutions may fail if they are perceived as burdensome, inequitable, or poorly aligned with the realities of the fishery.

However these mitigation strategies can only be successful with the buy-in and adoption of the fishers themselves 



In a sense, bycatch is an implicit feature of most fishing operations—very few gear types are capable of capturing only a single species, let alone only the marketable individuals within that species. However, this doesn’t mean it’s unmanageable.

Broadly, bycatch mitigation strategies fall into three categories:

1. **Closures**: These are regulatory measures that restrict fishing in areas or times when bycatch is too high or when bycatch quotas have been met. While effective in reducing bycatch, closures can have severe economic impacts on fishers who lose access to valuable grounds or seasons.
    
2. **Fishing process changes**: These are adjustments fishers make to when, where, or how they fish. For example, avoiding certain times of day, testing trawl areas before committing, or using shared information to steer away from high-bycatch zones. These measures are flexible and often fisher-led, but can be labor-intensive or uncertain in effect.
    
3. **Technological changes**: Innovations like Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs), sorting grids, alternative hook types, and modified gear configurations aim to make fishing more selective. Some of these tools improve efficiency, while others may require investment or change long-standing practices.
    

In practice, mitigation strategies tend to either increase targeting efficiency or limit fishing effort through closures. The former can reduce ecological impact while sometimes improving operational efficiency, but often at a financial or logistical cost to fishers. The latter—closures—can have particularly harsh consequences for fleets already operating on thin margins.

This brings us to the human side of the equation. Any effective bycatch strategy must account for both ecological and socioeconomic realities. A technically effective solution may fail if it requires new gear or procedures that are too costly or difficult to adopt. Reduced catch efficiency, unclear results, or burdensome monitoring requirements can all discourage cooperation. Fishers may also be reluctant to participate in mitigation efforts if they perceive them as punitive or lacking evidence of effectiveness.

Thus, the success of any bycatch mitigation effort depends not just on its technical soundness, but on how well it integrates ecological goals with the lived realities of fishing communities.
