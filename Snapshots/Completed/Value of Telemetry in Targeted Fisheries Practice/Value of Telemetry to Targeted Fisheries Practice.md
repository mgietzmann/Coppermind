Understanding the where, when, and who of animal movement is essential for assessing the vulnerability of marine species to human activity. Whether the concern is bycatch, the targeting of specific life stages, or the impacts of other anthropogenic interactions, vulnerability can only be diagnosed with a clear picture of movement (Block, 2011). Identifying when and where animals intersect with fisheries is foundational for anticipating and mitigating risk (Roe, 2014) (Queiroz, 2019).

Critically, this isn’t just about identifying areas of prolonged residency. While regions of sustained occupancy certainly represent important zones of vulnerability (Block, 2011), risk also accumulates in areas that act as migratory bottlenecks or thoroughfares (Hussey, 2015). Even brief passage by large portions of a population can make an area disproportionately important from a conservation or management perspective. These dynamics mean that effective intervention depends not only on identifying high-use areas, but on understanding the gradients of animal presence over space and time (Queiroz, 2019).

Movement dynamics is also foundational to designing spatial management strategies aimed at improvement selectivity. The success of time/area closures—whether periodic or dynamic—depends heavily on movement knowledge (Hussey, 2015). First one must know whether the spatial patterns of a species are predictable enough to be acted on. Then one must know what kind of strategy will be useful - for example dynamic closures depend on a degree of stasis in animal residency and closures designed to protect migration bottlenecks clearly need to be appropriately timed. Without this foundational knowledge, managers risk strategies that are misaligned with the life history and ecology of the species in consideration.

Traditional approaches to gathering this kind of information—such as fishery-independent surveys or fisheries-dependent catch data—are limited (Hussey, 2015). Moving animals can quickly leave the area between survey events, and the vast range of possible movements makes resampling logistically and financially prohibitive. In the case of rare or wide-ranging species, standard sampling is effectively unworkable (Block, 2002) (Roe, 2014). Fisheries-dependent data, meanwhile, are biased by where fishing actually occurs and often reflect effort and gear selectivity as much as species abundance or behavior (Quieroz, 2019). Furthermore if fisheries become effective at avoiding specific age classes or protected species, information on their movement patterns will quickly disappear. 

This is where electronic tagging become essential. Rather than chasing animals through space, tagging allows us to follow them directly. With satellite and archival tags, researchers can reconstruct movements, environmental preferences, and depth use over time (Block, 2002) (Hussey, 2015) (Cermeño, 2015). However, even with tagging, sample sizes are limited, and tagged individuals only provide slices of the full picture (Roe, 2014).

To turn these slices into system-level knowledge, movement models are essential. These models allow us to simulate and predict behavior across populations, incorporating environmental drivers and stochastic elements (Block, 2011) (Hussey, 2015). With a well-constructed model, we can do more than describe past movement—we can play out what-if scenarios (Hussey, 2015) (Roe, 2014): How much exposure would a proposed closure reduce? What duration of dynamic closure is optimal given observed transit times? How synchronized is migration, and how would its disruption shift overlap with fishing?

Ultimately, movement models built on tagging data are a gateway to truly responsive management—tools that can quantify tradeoffs, guide interventions, and support both ecological resilience and economic viability.
