 
Understanding the where, when, and who of animal movement is essential for assessing the vulnerability of marine species to human activity. Whether the concern is bycatch, the targeting of specific life stages, or the impacts of other anthropogenic interactions, vulnerability can only be diagnosed with a clear picture of movement (Block, 2011). Identifying when and where animals intersect with fisheries is foundational for anticipating and mitigating risk (Roe, 2014) (Queiroz, 2019).

Critically, this isn’t just about identifying areas of prolonged residency. While regions of sustained occupancy certainly represent important zones of vulnerability (Block, 2011), risk also accumulates in areas that act as migratory bottlenecks or thoroughfares (Hussey, 2015). Even brief passage by large portions of a population can make an area disproportionately important from a conservation or management perspective. These dynamics mean that effective intervention depends not only on identifying high-use areas, but on understanding the gradients of animal presence over space and time (Queiroz, 2019).

Movement dynamics is also foundational to designing spatial management strategies aimed at improvement selectivity. The success of time/area closures—whether periodic or dynamic—depends heavily on movement knowledge (Hussey, 2015). First one must know whether the spatial patterns of a species are predictable enough to be acted on. Then one must know what kind of strategy will be useful - for example dynamic closures depend on a degree of stasis in animal residency and closures designed to protect migration bottlenecks clearly need to be appropriately timed. Without this foundational knowledge, managers risk strategies that are misaligned with the life history and ecology of the species in consideration.

Traditional approaches to gathering this kind of information—such as fishery-independent surveys or fisheries-dependent catch data—are limited (Hussey, 2015). Moving animals can quickly leave the area between survey events, and the vast range of possible movements makes resampling logistically and financially prohibitive. In the case of rare or wide-ranging species, standard sampling is effectively unworkable (Block, 2002) (Roe, 2014). Fisheries-dependent data, meanwhile, are biased by where fishing actually occurs and often reflect effort and gear selectivity as much as species abundance or behavior (Quieroz, 2019). Furthermore if fisheries become effective at avoiding specific age classes or protected species, information on their movement patterns will quickly disappear. 

This is where electronic tagging become essential. Rather than chasing animals through space, tagging allows us to follow them directly. With satellite and archival tags, researchers can reconstruct movements, environmental preferences, and depth use over time (Block, 2002) (Hussey, 2015) (Cermeño, 2015). However, even with tagging, sample sizes are limited, and tagged individuals only provide slices of the full picture (Roe, 2014).

To turn these slices into system-level knowledge, movement models are essential. These models allow us to simulate and predict behavior across populations, incorporating environmental drivers and stochastic elements (Block, 2011) (Hussey, 2015). With a well-constructed model, we can do more than describe past movement—we can play out what-if scenarios (Hussey, 2015) (Roe, 2014): How much exposure would a proposed closure reduce? What duration of dynamic closure is optimal given observed transit times? How synchronized is migration, and how would its disruption shift overlap with fishing?

Ultimately, movement models built on tagging data are a gateway to truly responsive management—tools that can quantify tradeoffs, guide interventions, and support both ecological resilience and economic viability.

- The management and conservation of highly migratory marine predators depends on understanding how movements relate to ocean processes; however, the dynamic relationships among behaviour, physiology and oceanography over a range of temporal and spatial scales remains unclear (Block, 2011)
- Annual migratory periodicity was evident in the movements of many tagged animals that showed fidelity to the cool, nutrient-rich waters of the CCLME (Block, 2011)
- Other taxa undertook movements between near-shore and offshore waters, with a residency period within the CCLME or the Gulf of Alaska, followed by an offshore migration that ranged into the North Pacific transition zone (NPTZ) (female elephant seals, salmon sharks and Laysan albatrosses), the subtropical gyre and north equatorial current (blue and mako sharks and leatherback sea turtles), or the ‘Caf ́ e’ region of the eastern Pacific and the Hawaiian Islands (white sharks; albacore tunas, Thunnus alalunga; and black-footed albatrosses). (Block, 2011)
- Climate Change Related Stuff
	- The quarterly predator density in relation to the median satellitederived SST measurements within the CCLME (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3) suggests that seasonal warming (quarter three) along the Baja California peninsula may trigger northward movements of predator populations. (Block, 2011)
- Differences in habitat use evident among congeneric species illustrate how more-recently divergent species partition the oceanic environment (Fig. 5). (Block, 2011)
- The concentration and residency of multiple predators at predictable locations in the Pacific reveals the importance of these regions as biological hotspots (Block, 2011)
- Tracking data can be used to examine behaviours and distributions, inform population assessments and improve estimates of natural and fishery-induced mortality (Block, 2011)
- The recovery of cetacean populations, such as blue whales, which are endangered, can be enhanced through the use of electronic tracking data to identify high-use areas and coordinate policy actions that mitigate anthropogenic risks (Block, 2011)
- move, which facilitates countless ecological processes. Animals move to acquire food, avoid predation or adverse conditions, seek out suitable mates, and locate spawning or nursery areas (Hussey, 2015)
- we can now begin to tease apart population processes built on individual-level behavior. (Hussey, 2015)
- This has revealed the intricacies and previously unanticipated complexity of migratory paths of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus)(22), unsuspected transoceanic migrations of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) (Fig. 2B) and white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) (23, 24), and transequatorial migrations of basking sharks (Hussey, 2015)
- themselves to an understanding of the mechanistic drivers of population structure and connectivity and metapopulation dynamics of species through quantifying emigration and immigration (Hussey, 2015)
- Examining how animals optimally synchronize their endogenous biological clocks with geophysical cycles is a critical step to resolving species’ temporal distributions (Hussey, 2015)
- The longevity of electronic tags now allows for measures of the consistency, repeatability, and interindividual variation in animal movements over time and, ultimately, during behavioral ontogeny. (Hussey, 2015)
- Through multiyear satellite telemetry of leatherback turtles, fidelity to a single migratory route was identified, providing clear conservation recommendations for a population that has declined by >90% over the past two decades (Hussey, 2015)
- Astelemetrydatabecomemoreavailable,management strategies are incorporating geophysical cycles, variation in species’ life histories, and environmental stochasticity to guide dynamic spatial planning efforts (Hussey, 2015)
- For southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus macoyii), this approach integrated a habitat model conditioned with temperaturepreference data from satellite tags on fish with an open-ocean model to enable near–real-time predictions of fish occurrence. These data were made available to fisheries managers, leading to the implementation of complex dynamic spatial zoning through which managers request data and repeatedly update spatial zoning plans. (Hussey, 2015)
- Conversely, sympatric jellyfishes (56)andwhales(57)(Fig.3A), with known dietary overlap, exhibited contrasting movements to avoid direct resource competition. (Hussey, 2015)
- Eighteen species of acoustically tagged reef fishes in the Caribbean region showed fidelity to marine protected areas (MPAs). However, three-quarters of the species examined travelled outside their protective limits (Hussey, 2015)
- Through characterizing daily, seasonal, and multiyear scales of species movements and interactions, as well as of imperilled species distributions and biodiversity hotspots, these data will be foundational for macroscale marine ecosystem management. (Hussey, 2015)
- In salmonids, combining telemetry measurements with laboratory manipulation of their endocrine and neurophysiology revealed links between migration speed, timing, and testosterone concentrations and the mechanisms underlying migration timing and homing in these commercially and culturally important fish (Hussey, 2015)
- This approach has proven extremely effective for sampling regions that are logistically challenging and costly to observe, for example, areas under sea ice during fall and winter (Hussey, 2015)
- The terrestrial approach is built on understanding the causes, changes, and ecological functions associated with spatial animal-environment patterns under a nonequilibrium view. Aquatic resource management requires a similar approach, but its adoption has been hindered by a lack of data over relevant spatiotemporal scales. Telemetry can now provide these data, facilitating aquatic-scape approaches for conservation and management, while also bridging the gap between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (97), inspiring a unifie (Hussey, 2015)

### Tagging as the only way to gather data

The difficulty of working with marine vertebrates in extreme environments far from land has made acquisition of data on their biology challenging. Assessment of movements, foraging habitat and breeding areas of marine megafauna remain technically difficult because most large, marine nekton are active, difficult to handle, and spend little (if any) time at or near the surface, thus remaining far from sight. (Block, 2002)

One of the biggest barriers to predicting bycatch events is the difficulty of collecting sufficient data in large and dynamic ocean systems, especially for species that move long distances. In the case of migratory pelagic vertebrates, detailed knowledge of ocean-scale movements has only recently come to light with technological advancements that allow individuals to be tracked via satellite for extended periods (Roe, 2014)

However, obtaining unbiased estimates of the distributions of sharks and fishing effort is complicated by the fact that most data on pelagic sharks come from catch records and other fishery-dependent sources (Quieroz, 2019)

Studies based on electronic archival and pop-up satellite archival tags in the past decade have been instrumental in identifying the details of bluefin tuna movement patterns, vertical distributions, temperature preferences and feeding habits. (Cermeño, 2015)

### WhoWhenWhere is Foundational

For many commercially important species (tunas, sharks), understanding habitat (structure, spawning sites, foraging locations, migratory routes and temporal and spatial movement patterns in relationship to the ocean environment) forms the foundation for future conservation and management of these valuable resources; for depleted or protected species, the same knowledge can aid in recovery. (Block, 2002)

Incorporation of animal-collected data into an integrated ocean model will help fill data gaps that can provide a better understanding of ocean atmosphere coupling and its role in meteorology and long term climate change. (Block, 2002)

In the absence of detailed data on observed bycatch, targeted management to reduce or avoid bycatch requires knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution of fishing effort, an understanding of non-target species distribution and behaviour over space and time, and information on relative probability of capture should fisheries and non-target animals co-occur. Predictive models can then be developed to identify hotspots and times of potential interaction to inform bycatch mitigation strategies (Roe, 2014)

The conservation of pelagic sharks—the management of which on the high seas is currently limited12,15,16—would benefit greatly from a clearer understanding of the spatial relationships between the habitats of sharks and active fishing zones. (Queiroz, 2019)

The highest levels of exposure risk of sharks to longline fisheries were not constant through time, but instead varied seasonally as space use by sharks and fishing vessels shifted in relation to each other (Quieroz, 2019)

### Some Models

To explore the spatial heterogeneities of sharks and vessels, we used generalized additive models to determine how the relative density of location estimates for sharks and the distribution of longline-fishing effort were affected by environmental covariates (Quieroz, 2019)

### How to Properly Use the Data

We note that transmitters were not allocated in proportion to actual nesting population size, nor did we attempt to weight data to reflect population sizes (only sample population size). Thus, our relative use intensities may not reflect actual turtle densities. (Roe, 2014)

For EP nesters, an area of potential risk occurs along the primary leatherback migration corridor between Costa Rica and the Gala ́pagos Islands. Though this area was predicted to be of moderate bycatch risk, it occurred along a persistent migration path for nesting leatherbacks [14,17], thus representing a potential chronic threat during a critical phase in the life cycle of reproductive adult turtles. (Roe, 2014)

### Themes

- Understanding residency, migration, and the cycle of life
- Understanding where different behaviors may be playing out
- Understanding potential for different kinds of selectivity
- Understanding potential for different levels of mortality (in guiding mortality studies)
- Understanding where monitoring programs may have more success
- Understanding how often breeding happens (and therefore some indication of productivity)
- Understanding how climate is going to change all of the above
- Understanding how the stock may in fact be a series of stocks
- Understanding how various stocks are being affected by other fisheries 
- Understanding how the stocks may interact with different ecosystems

- Selectivity
- Subdivisions
- Mortality
- Monitoring
- Interactions
- Productivity

The point of this model is to:

- Test hypotheses that specific factors are actually driving movement 
- Then play out those hypotheses to understand what influences the above

I.e. move past the individuals and into the actual currents. 

I'm going to break each of these out into its own thing. This'll just be good for me to know honestly. 
### Some Thoughts

#### "Damage"

The simplest way to think about fisheries management is in terms of mortality and recruitment. There is a cycle with an escape valve. Obviously fish are not going to breed up to an infinite size so there's some amount of density dependence. That gets captured by differences in natural mortality at different densities. There's a certain number of adult fish that need to show up to produce more offspring than can actually survive. 

Under this simplest way of thinking we just want a certain amount of adult biomass to exist. So if the fish experience a yearly mortality $M_t$ then you want to make sure you increase this only so much so that the long term size of the adult population under this new $M^{'}_t$ stays large enough to keep producing the large number of offspring. I.e. you are taking advantage of the "overproductivity" of the animal to get food. 

**Measuring Impact** Behavior becomes really important because for highly mobile fish to even get a sense of how you are effecting the population you need to find ways to catch them in abundance. 

"Big Ole Fat Female Fish" where certain fish are more productive than others by quite a bit. 

Biases in fish quality. If I target a feeding ground and catch fish that are feeding well more than fish that are feeding poorly I can negatively effect the productivity quite easily. 

The big question really though is how to keep track of how the productivity is going to change with time given how much folks are catching and where. Bycatch is another huge problem. 

>There's no way to either understand or measure population dynamics without understanding life history over time and place. 

Once you can understand life history you can create a program to:

1. Monitor fish in those life stages (mortality, abundance, etc.)
2. And then suggest management policy

Within this targeting becomes important because the fish are likely not as evenly productive at all life stages. 

Movement, mortality, and so on all comes from tagging.

# Why Movement Matters in Fisheries Management  
**Friday, April 4th, 2025 – 7:48 PM, Rochester, NY**

A really easy way to think about why movement matters is through the classic version of fisheries management, which begins by assuming that fish are *r-selected*. That just means adults typically produce way more young than can survive. In doing so, they provide an ecological buffer—if adults experience dramatic mortality in some years, it doesn’t matter much because they’ll still overproduce and regenerate the population.

I’ve talked before about how, as expected age at death increases, r-selection starts to get *really* wacky. That’s probably why longer-lived species are (what is it?) *K-selected*, or whatever.

Anyway, under that assumption, the goal becomes: just keep enough biomass around so the species can keep reproducing.

> Side note: we're ignoring for now any ecological impact that might come from reducing a species’ average biomass. It could be food for something else, causing knock-on population effects. But let’s keep it simple for now.

---

## What You Need to Know to Manage Based on Biomass

If all you care about is keeping biomass at a specific level, there are a few key things you need:

- **Growth by Age** – How age relates to size  
- **Productivity** – How size relates to reproductive output (e.g., eggs laid)  
- **Mortality** – The rate at which fish die at different life stages

From there, you usually plug into some kind of **Ricker curve** or similar model, where:

- There's a **non-compensatory section** (linear response to spawning biomass), and
- A **compensatory section** (where adding more spawners doesn’t increase recruitment).

You want to stay **well above** the no-compensation threshold to avoid trouble.

So you need to understand:
1. How far you can drop before compensation breaks down,
2. Productivity patterns, and
3. Mortality rates.

In a perfect, constant world, you could manage based on that.

---

## Problem #1: Selectivity

Even if your model is solid, you still run into problems because fisheries aren’t sampling a perfectly mixed pool of fish. Depending on how and where they fish, fishermen disproportionately hit certain **age classes**.

So not all fish are equally vulnerable. Some age groups might get hammered while others remain untouched. And that alone can lead to collapse—one age class takes too much pressure, and the whole population can shrink to zero over time.

So even with good models of natural dynamics, **selectivity** matters—a lot.

---

## Problem #2: Mortality Isn't Predictable

If you stop assuming mortality is fixed and instead say, "We need to **measure** it," then you run straight back into the **selectivity** problem.

To measure mortality:
- You need consistent sampling,
- You need to understand how fish movement affects your sampling,
- You need to account for life history and behavioral patterns.

Even if mortality is due to events (e.g., predation, environmental shocks), you can’t interpret those events unless you know how the fish live and move.

So your abundance estimates and your understanding of mortality both depend on how fish **move** through space and time.

---

## Bottom Line: Movement, Selectivity, and Life History Are Core

Whether it’s:
- Making accurate assessments,
- Understanding mortality,
- Sampling abundance correctly, or
- Modeling population dynamics…

You **have to** understand:
- **Movement**
- **Selectivity**
- **Life history**

Without that, you're just taking blind shots in the dark.

---

## So Tag Fish

That’s the point here: **go tag fish**. And keep tagging them. See if things change—especially in the face of climate change.

---

## In Ecosystem-Based Management? Even More Critical

All of this becomes *even more* important when we shift to **ecosystem-based management**. Because now we’re not just managing fish—we’re managing food webs, predators, prey, and habitats.

Without understanding movement, selectivity, and life history?

> No chance.

That’s all I wanted to get at.

----

All of this really comes back to three simple questions - who, where, and when. Who comes down to separable groups that behave differently. Where and when comes down to how they move about the place. With these three answered you can start asking questions like - where should I do monitoring, where should other fisheries avoid, where should my fishery go? 

The point here is that we can take this underlying model and ask ourselves - how does this relate to the basic mechanics of running a fishery. And I think the first one I'm interested in interactions with other fisheries. But to understand that we have to get into where are the fish going. I guess my question at the moment is what search terms do I hit in order to get answers to how others have done this in the past. 

The answer here is to understand how they collect and how we can end up with high amounts of exposure.
