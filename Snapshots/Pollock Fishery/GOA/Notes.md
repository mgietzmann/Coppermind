- The management of Pollock follows the division in Fisheries Management Plans (FMPs) between the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) as set forward by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC). Therefore when we talk about management we have to consider which of these regions we're talking about. 
- The GOA management area is further subdivided into Western, Central, and Eastern regulatory areas. For Pollock fishing the Western and Central areas are the most important as the Eastern Regulatory district has a prohibition on trawl use in the Southeast outside district which composes about half of the Eastern regulatory district. The Western and Central regions are combined in establishing TAC to better conserve and manage the resource.
- The pollock fishery is managed through the determination of a TAC which when reached causes the closure of the fishery in the GOA. This TAC is based off of a stock assessment and fishery evaluation report. TAC is further divided for pollock into seasonal allowances. 
- Seasons are generally divided into A and B with A running from January to March and B running from August to October.
- All the pollock TAC is allocated to inshore fisheries for the GOA pollock FMP.
- TAC is determined through a stock assessment that is based upon NMFS data on catch, the NMFS bottom trawl survey, the ADF&G crab/groundfish trawl survey, the Summer Acoustic-Trawl survey, and the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey
- Vessels allowed to fish in the fishery all require a federal ground fish license except for vessels only fishing in State of Alaska waters or those less than 26'. 
- Licenses were handed out initially in 1995 on the basis of historical landings and were giving to the owners of vessels and are associated with a specific fishing area (western and/or central). They are also associated with a vessel size. It is also associated with the kind of gear used to achieve those landings. Licenses can be revoked and they can be sold. 
- All in all this setup creates a derby fishery where the TAC in each season is raced for. 
- Finally there are prohibited species catch (PSC) limits specifically for halibut and chinook salmon although all salmon "must be retained until an observer is provided the opportunity to count the number of salmon and to collect scientific data or biological samples from the salmon."  
- Time and Area Closures can also be instantiated to reduce PSC rates. 
- The limits on PSC's for chinook are 18,316 in the Central fishery and 6,684 in the Western pollock fishery. This also is reapportioned if "Chinook salmon PSC that is projected to be unused in the sector to which it was initially apportioned" this is limited to roughly half of the apportion in each region.
- There is an observer program that is run by NMFS and requires partial or full observer coverage depending on vessel size. This is addition to the logs that are maintained by the producers themselves. 
- The retained catch in 2020 was 107mt with a first wholesale value of $70.6million and an ex-vessel value of $27.8 million. 
- In terms of the kind of gear used we have:
	- "When fishing pollock, most of the fleet uses large mesh mid-water trawls. Pelagic trawls typically have a headrope to footrope vertical distance rise of 20 fathoms and a horizontal opening of 40 fathoms (wing-end spread of 60 fathoms) for vessels with an average 1,000 hp. Front meshes of large mid-water nets may be as large as 120 feet. Net mesh gets smaller towards the intermediate and codend, with the codend typically having 5-inch stretched mesh. Doors are made of steel and range in size from 3 m2 up to 7 m2. Door spread in most fishing depths and trawl warp/scope combinations is typically 100 m to 180 m. There are no discs attached to the footropes on pelagic trawls. Trawls may be fitted with sonar systems designed to monitor net performance remotely." That's for the central component
	- For the western component we have: "The fleet consists of small catcher vessels and large catcher processors. The smaller vessels generally use smaller sized bottom trawls that take less horsepower to tow. The fleet fishes for a wide variety of species, with targets varying across seasons. The catcher vessels begin the year by targeting Pacific cod, moving on to catch pollock, then other species. Several of the Amendment 80 vessels also participate in the Western GOA fisheries, targeting flatfish, Pacific cod, and rockfish using the same gear they use in the Bering Sea."
- In terms of vessels themselves we have:
	- "The Central GOA trawl fleet had 10 catcher processors (Amendment 80 vessels) and 43 catcher vessels participating in 2010. Many of the vessels also participate in other fleets including 19 in the AFA catcher vessel fleet, 11 in the Western GOA trawl fleet, and a few in other fleets using longline or pot gear."
	- For western GOA: "The smaller catcher vessels in this fleet participate in many other fisheries and can switch out trawl gear to allow vessels to use longlines in halibut and groundfish fisheries, or pot gear in groundfish and crab fisheries, or seine gear for salmon. The catcher processors in the fleet are Amendment 80 vessels."
- In the central region we see:
	- "The pollock trawl fishery in the GOA operates all around Kodiak Island, with effort concentrated on the southern side of Kodiak, off Cape Chiniak. Pollock tend to aggregate in large groups, and the fishery generally occurs in areas with sand, sandy silt, muddy bottom, and pelagic over hard rocky bottoms at depths of 20 fathoms to 250 fathoms."
- The fleet in the Western component primarily hails from the aleutians and washington state whereas the central component hails from kodiak, oregon, and washington state

The pollock fishery in Alaska is managed under two distinct Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) established by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC): one for the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and one for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) (NPFMC, 2024). This division necessitates clear regional distinctions when discussing pollock management. Within the GOA, management is further subdivided into Western, Central, and Eastern regulatory areas. However, the Eastern area plays a limited role in trawl-caught pollock due to a prohibition on trawl gear in the Southeast Outside District, which makes up roughly half of that area. Consequently, most pollock fishing effort and management focus on the Western and Central GOA, which are combined for purposes of setting Total Allowable Catch (TAC).

TAC for GOA pollock is determined annually based on stock assessments and fishery evaluation reports. These assessments incorporate data from multiple sources, including NMFS catch records, the NMFS bottom trawl survey, ADF&G trawl surveys, the Summer Acoustic-Trawl Survey, and the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey (Monnahan, 2021). Once the TAC is set, it is divided into seasonal quotas, typically split between an A season (January–March) and a B season (August–October) (NOAA, 2025). All of the pollock TAC in the GOA is currently allocated to inshore fisheries. The fishery closes once the seasonal or annual TAC is reached, creating a derby-style environment in which vessels race to harvest their share before closure (NPFMC, 2024).

Participation in the fishery requires a federal groundfish license, with exceptions for vessels under 26 feet or those operating in state waters. These licenses were initially issued in 1995 based on historical landings and are specific to region, vessel size, and gear type (NPFMC, 2024). Licenses are sellable and may be revoked under certain conditions. Observer coverage, managed by NMFS, is required on most vessels, either partially or fully depending on vessel size. In addition, operators must maintain detailed logs, and salmon bycatch must be retained until scientific samples can be collected.

Bycatch management is a central feature of pollock fishery regulation. Prohibited species catch (PSC) limits are enforced for Chinook salmon and halibut. Chinook limits are set at 18,316 fish for the Central GOA and 6,684 for the Western GOA, with limited provisions for reallocation of unused PSC between sectors (NPFMC, 2024). Time and area closures may also be implemented to reduce bycatch rates.

In terms of gear, the Central GOA pollock fleet primarily employs large mesh pelagic trawls. These midwater trawls feature vertical openings of around 20 fathoms and horizontal spreads of 40 fathoms, with steel doors up to 7 m² and codend mesh typically around 5 inches (NPFMC, 2012). Some trawls are equipped with sonar systems for real-time performance monitoring. In the Western GOA, smaller catcher vessels operate with more varied bottom trawls, suitable for lower horsepower and a broader range of species.

The Central GOA fleet, as of 2010, included 10 catcher processors and 43 catcher vessels. Many of these vessels also participate in other fisheries and regions, including 19 vessels in the American Fisheries Act (AFA) fleet and 11 also active in the Western GOA (NPFMC, 2012). The Central fishery is centered around Kodiak Island, particularly the southern coast near Cape Chiniak, where pollock aggregate over sandy and muddy substrates at depths of 20 to 250 fathoms. The Western GOA fleet includes smaller, more flexible catcher vessels capable of switching between trawl, longline, pot, and seine gear depending on season and target species. While many vessels hail from Alaska, especially the Aleutians for the Western and Kodiak for the Central management regions, others originate out of state from Oregon and Washington, reflecting a broad geographic spread of the fleet.

In 2020, the retained pollock catch from the GOA totaled 107,000 metric tons, with a first wholesale value of $70.6 million and an ex-vessel value of $27.8 million, highlighting the economic significance of this fishery to the region (Monnahan, 2021).****
