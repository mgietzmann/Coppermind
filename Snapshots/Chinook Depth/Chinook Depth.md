Previous studies examining Chinook salmon depth distribution have identified several major and consistent patterns. First is the fact that Chinook tend to occupy a specific portion of the water column between 0 and 50m although they can be found in depths exceeding 500m (Courtney, 2019, 2021). Beyond this seasonality is one of the strongest predictors, with Chinook salmon generally occupying shallower depths in the spring and progressively deeper waters in summer, fall, and winter (Freshwater, 2024) (Orsi, 1995) (Walker, 2007). Additionally, diel variability has been observed, although with substantial individual differences (Freshwater, 2024) (Arostegui, 2017). Unlike species exhibiting a classic diel vertical migration (DVM) pattern—ascending at night and descending during the day—Chinook salmon display more flexible diel behaviors, sometimes reversing their movement patterns seasonally (Arostegui, 2017). Response to bottom depth is another key driver, with salmon distribution often correlating strongly with bathymetry, though fine-scale topographic influences remain less well understood (Freshwater, 2024). Similarly, size and maturity play a role, with larger fish tending to be found at deeper depths (Freshwater, 2024). However, these patterns only emerge in the aggregate as individual variation is extreme, with salmon spending less than 25% of their time at any single 5-meter depth increment (Orsi, 1995), highlighting the importance of large datasets for characterizing their depth distribution.

Less consistent patterns have been reported for temperature, productivity indicators, and current velocity and other temporal drivers like the lunar cycle (Freshwater, 2024) (Orsi, 1995). Productivity-related features, such as zooplankton concentration and chlorophyll-a levels, have been weakly predictive, with some studies suggesting indirect links—such as higher chlorophyll-a near the surface in spring coinciding with shallower salmon distributions, potentially due to increased prey availability or reduced predation risk from decreased water clarity (Freshwater, 2024). Similarly, current velocity and thermocline depth have shown only weak relationships with depth selection (Freshwater, 2024).

Several plausible explanations exist for the stronger patterns observed in Chinook salmon depth distributions. Light availability has been hypothesized as a key driver, influencing both foraging efficiency and predator avoidance (Orsi, 1995). Many pelagic fish adjust their vertical position to balance the trade-off between feeding opportunities and the risk of predation, particularly from visually oriented predators like harbor seals (Smith, 2015). Seasonal shifts in prey behavior are another critical factor, as key forage fish such as Pacific herring exhibit predictable depth changes throughout the year, which salmon may track (Freshwater, 2024). Lastly, bathymetric and environmental structuring—such as bottom depth and potentially seafloor slope—may shape salmon depth use. However, most of these explanations remain hypotheses.
